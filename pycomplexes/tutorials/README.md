This directory contains several use-case examples for complexes++ and
pycomplexes. The examples are written as jupyter notebooks to interleave bash
commands and an explanation of what is being done.

To install the jupyter program we recommend the anaconda distribution. Please
note that some examples use pycomplexes as a python library. Therefore please
ensure that pycomplexes is installed in your conda environment.
