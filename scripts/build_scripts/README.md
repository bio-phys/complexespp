This folder contains the build scripts used to generate a Docker image for
continues integration. But these scripts can also be used for convenience to
install complexes and it's dependencies.

# Install Complexes
To have a normal build run the following commands

    ./build_deps.sh
    ./build_dynamic.sh

This will install complexes in `~/complexes-pp/bin`. To change this path modify
`build.cfg`. To build a static binary replace the last command with
`./build_static.sh`.

# Build Docker Image

To create the docker image run `sudo ./build-docker-image.sh`. This commands
needs to be run with sudo rights because docker doesn't work for normal users.

## Test Docker Image locally

You can test the Docker image by creating a short scripts that downloads the
complexes repo and runs the tests.

    git clone https://github.com/bio-phys/complexespp.git /builds/gitlab-org/complexes-pp
    cd /builds/gitlab-org/complexes-pp
    # copy of script lines in `.gitlab-ci.yml` from root folder
    bash scripts/gitlab-ci/gitlab-python-ci.sh
    bash scripts/gitlab-ci/gitlab-complexes-ci.sh
    bash scripts/gitlab-ci/gitlab-tutorials-ci.sh

To run the build as a test use.

    sudo docker run -i --name build_test complexes-builder /bin/bash < build_script
