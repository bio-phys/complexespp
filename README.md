Complexes consists of two separate programs: 

- *complexes++* a Monte-Carlo engine to run simulations
- *pycomplexes** a helper toolbox to setup and visualize simulations

**Descriptions how to install each program can be found in the respective sub-directories.**

To find detailed description of theory and implemented Monte-Carlo algorithms
please have a look into the [manual](https://github.com/bio-phys/complexespp/blob/main/manual/manual.pdf).

# Documentation

## Tutorials
Tutorials how to use *complexes++* and
*pycomplexes* can be found in the tutorials folder.

Tutorials are jupyter notebooks that can be run once complexes++ and pycomplexes are correctly installed.
They should be a good starting point for your own simulations.

## Theory

In `docs/theory.pdf` we explain the theory behind complexes.

## Architecture

If you are interested how the code of complexes is designed or want to extent it.
In `docs/architecture.pdf` we explain the code architecture of complexes.
