Complexes consists of two separate programs: 

- *complexes++* a Monte-Carlo engine to run simulations
- *pycomplexes** a helper toolbox to setup and visualize simulations

**Descriptions how to install each program can be found in the respective sub-directories.**

To find detailed description of theory and implemented Monte-Carlo algorithms
please have a look into the [manual](https://github.com/bio-phys/complexespp/blob/main/manual/manual.pdf).

Tutorials how to use *complexes++* and
*pycomplexes* can be found in the tutorials folder.
