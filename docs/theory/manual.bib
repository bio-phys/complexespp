abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The interaction between the Heat Shock Proteins 70 and 40 is at the core of the ATPase regulation of the chaperone machinery that maintains protein homeostasis. However, the structural details of the interaction remain elusive and contrasting models have been proposed for the transient Hsp70/Hsp40 complexes. Here we combine molecular simulations based on both coarse-grained and atomistic models with coevolutionary sequence analysis to shed light on this problem by focusing on the bacterial DnaK/DnaJ system. The integration of these complementary approaches resulted in a novel structural model that rationalizes previous experimental observations. We identify an evolutionarily conserved interaction surface formed by helix II of the DnaJ J-domain and a structurally contiguous region of DnaK, involving lobe IIA of the nucleotide binding domain, the inter-domain linker, and the $\beta$-basket of the substrate binding domain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is made clear that the divergence of the lattice sums pointed out by Burgers may be rescued by taking into account the presence of the mean pressure gradient. As an application of these solutions the force acting on any one of the small spheres forming a periodic array is considered. Cases for three special types of cubic lattice are investigated in detail. It is found that the ratios of the values of this force to that given by the Stokes formula for an isolated sphere are larger than 1 and do not differ so much among these three types provided that the volume concentration of the spheres is the same and small. The method is also applied to the two-dimensional flow past a square array of circular cylinders, and the drag on one of the cylinders is found to agree with that calculated by the use of elliptic functions.},

abstract = {Structural biology elucidates atomic structures of macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, RNA, and their complexes to understand the basic mechanisms of their functions. Among proteins that pose the most difficult problems to current efforts are those which have several large domains connected by long, flexible polypeptide segments. Although abundant and critically important in biological cells, such proteins have proven intractable by conventional techniques. This gap has recently led to the advancement of hybrid methods that use state-of-the-art computational tools to combine complementary data from various high- and low-resolution experiments. In this review, we briefly discuss the individual experimental techniques to illustrate their strengths and limitations, and then focus on the use of hybrid methods in structural biology. We describe how representative structures of dynamic multi-protein complexes are obtained utilizing the EROS hybrid method that we have co-developed.},

abstract = {Rabex-5 is an exchange factor for Rab5, a master regulator of endosomal trafficking. Rabex-5 binds monoubiquitin, undergoes covalent ubiquitination and contains an intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity, all of which require an N-terminal A20 zinc finger followed immediately by a helix. The structure of the N-terminal portion of Rabex-5 bound to ubiquitin at 2.5-A resolution shows that Rabex-5-ubiquitin interactions occur at two sites. The first site is a new type of ubiquitin-binding domain, an inverted ubiquitin-interacting motif, which binds with approximately 29-microM affinity to the canonical Ile44 hydrophobic patch on ubiquitin. The second is a diaromatic patch on the A20 zinc finger, which binds with approximately 22-microM affinity to a polar region centered on Asp58 of ubiquitin. The A20 zinc-finger diaromatic patch mediates ubiquitin-ligase activity by directly recruiting a ubiquitin-loaded ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme.},

abstract = {The various factors that influence the reliable and efficient determination of the correlation time describing molecular reorientation of proteins by NMR relaxation methods are examined. Nuclear Overhauser effects, spin-lattice, and spin-spin relaxation parameters of 15N NMR relaxation in ubiquitin have been determined at 17.6, 14.1, 11.7 and 9.4 Tesla. This unusually broad set of relaxation parameters has allowed the examination of the influence of chemical shift anisotropy, the functional form of the model-free spectral density, and the reliability of determined spin-spin relaxation parameters on the characterization of global tumbling of the protein. Treating the 15N chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) as an adjustable parameter, a consensus value of -170 +/- 15 ppm for the breadth of the chemical shift tensor and a global isotropic correlation time of 4.1 ns are found when using the model-free spectral density to fit T1 and NOE data from all fields. The inclusion of T2 relaxation parameters in the determination of the global correlation time results in its increase to 4.6 ns. This apparent inconsistency may explain a large portion of the discrepancy often found between NMR- and fluorescence-derived tau m values for proteins. The near identity of observed T2 and T1 rho values suggests that contributions from slow motions are not the origin of the apparent inconsistency with obtained T1 and NOE data. Various considerations suggest that the origin of this apparent discrepancy may reside in a contribution to the spectral density at zero frequency that is not represented by the simple model-free formalism in addition to the usual experimental difficulties associated with the measurement of these relaxation parameters. Finally, an axially symmetric diffusion tensor for ubiquitin is obtained using exclusively T1 and NOE data. A recommendation is reached on the types and combinations of relaxation data that can be used to reliably determine tau m values. It is also noted that the reliable determination of tau m values from 15N T1 and NOE relaxation parameters will become increasingly difficult as tau m increases.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a method for determining the rotational diffusion tensor from NMR relaxation data using a combination of approximate and exact methods. The approximate method, which is computationally less intensive, computes values of the principal components of the diffusion tensor and estimates the Euler angles, which relate the principal axis frame of the diffusion tensor to the molecular frame. The approximate values of the principal components are then used as starting points for an exact calculation by a downhill simplex search for the principal components of the tensor over a grid of the space of Euler angles relating the diffusion tensor frame to the molecular frame. The search space of Euler angles is restricted using the tensor orientations calculated using the approximate method. The utility of this approach is demonstrated using both simulated and experimental relaxation data. A quality factor that determines the extent of the agreement between the measured and predicted relaxation data is provided. This approach is then used to estimate the relative orientation of SH3 and SH2 domains in the SH(32) dual-domain construct of Abelson kinase complexed with a consolidated ligand.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can describe protein motions in atomic detail, but transitions between protein conformational states sometimes take place on time scales that are infeasible or very expensive to reach by direct simulation. Enhanced sampling methods, the aim of which is to increase the sampling efficiency of MD simulations, have thus been extensively employed. The effectiveness of such methods when applied to complex biological systems like proteins, however, has been difficult to establish because even enhanced sampling simulations of such systems do not typically reach time scales at which convergence is extensive enough to reliably quantify sampling efficiency. Here, we obtain sufficiently converged simulations of three proteins to evaluate the performance of simulated tempering, a member of a widely used class of enhanced sampling methods that use elevated temperature to accelerate sampling. Simulated tempering simulations with individual lengths of up to 100 $\mu$s were compared to (previously published) conventional MD simulations with individual lengths of up to 1 ms. With two proteins, BPTI and ubiquitin, we evaluated the efficiency of sampling of conformational states near the native state, and for the third, the villin headpiece, we examined the rate of folding and unfolding. Our comparisons demonstrate that simulated tempering can consistently achieve a substantial sampling speedup of an order of magnitude or more relative to conventional MD.},

To overcome possible flaws in root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)-based metrics, we introduce a novel discretization approach, based on coarse-grained contact maps. In addition, we extend the MSM methodology to include “sink” states in order to account for the irreversibility (on simulation time scales) of processes like protein misfolding.

abstract = {Molecular docking programs play an important role in drug development and many well-established methods exist. However, there are two situations for which the performance of most approaches is still not satisfactory, namely inclusion of receptor flexibility and docking of large, flexible ligands like peptides. In this publication a new approach is presented for docking peptides into flexible receptors. For this purpose a two step procedure was developed: first, the protein–peptide conformational space is scanned and approximate ligand poses are identified and second, the identified ligand poses are refined by a new molecular dynamics-based method, optimized potential molecular dynamics (OPMD). The OPMD approach uses soft-core potentials for the protein–peptide interactions and applies a new optimization scheme to the soft-core potential. Comparison with refinement results obtained by conventional molecular dynamics and a soft-core scaling approach shows significant improvements in the sampling capability for the OPMD method. Thus, the number of starting poses needed for successful refinement is much lower than for the other methods. The algorithm was evaluated on 15 protein–peptide complexes with 2–16mer peptides. Docking poses with peptide RMSD values {\textless}2.10 {\AA} from the equilibrated experimental structures were obtained in all cases. For four systems docking into the unbound receptor structures was performed, leading to peptide RMSD values {\textless}2.12 {\AA}. Using a specifically fitted scoring function in 11 of 15 cases the best scoring poses featured a peptide RMSD ≤2.10 {\AA}. Proteins 2010. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract Molecular simulation is a valuable and complementary tool that may assist with the interpretation of single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, if the energy function is of sufficiently high quality. Here we present force-field parameters for one of the most common pairs of chromophores used in experiments, AlexaFluor 488 and 594. From microsecond molecular-dynamics simulations, we are able to recover both experimentally determined equilibrium constants and association/dissociation rates of the chromophores with free tryptophan, as well as the decay of fluorescence anisotropy of a labeled protein. We find that it is particularly important to obtain a correct balance of solute-water interactions in the simulations in order to faithfully capture the experimental anisotropy decays, which provide a sensitive benchmark for fluorophore mobility. Lastly, by a combination of experiment and simulation, we address a potential complication in the interpretation of experiments on polyproline, used as a molecular ruler for FRET experiments, namely the potential association of one of the chromophores with the polyproline helix. Under conditions where simulations accurately capture the fluorescence anisotropy decay, we find at most a modest, transient population of conformations in which the chromophores associate with the polyproline. Explicit calculation of FRET transfer efficiencies for short polyprolines yields results in good agreement with experiment. These results illustrate the potential power of a combination of molecular simulation and experiment in quantifying biomolecular dynamics.},

Four different rigid nonpolarizable water models are assessed: SPC, SPC/E, TIP4P, and TIP4P/2005. The pressure dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity for pure liquid water is also calculated and the anomalous behavior of these properties is qualitatively well predicted. Furthermore, transport properties as well as excess volume and excess enthalpy of aqueous binary mixtures containing methanol or ethanol, based on the SPC/E and TIP4P/2005 water models, are calculated. Under the tested conditions, the TIP4P/2005 model gives the best quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments for the regarded transport properties. The deviations from experimental data are of 5{\%} to 15{\%} for pure liquid water and 5{\%} to 20{\%} for the water + alcohol mixtures. Moreover, the center of mass power spectrum of water as well as the investigated mixtures are analyzed and the hydrogen-bonding structure is discussed for different states.},

abstract = {Alkali (Li(+), Na(+), K(+), Rb(+), and Cs(+)) and halide (F(-), Cl(-), Br(-), and I(-)) ions play an important role in many biological phenomena, roles that range from stabilization of biomolecular structure, to influence on biomolecular dynamics, to key physiological influence on homeostasis and signaling. To properly model ionic interaction and stability in atomistic simulations of biomolecular structure, dynamics, folding, catalysis, and function, an accurate model or representation of the monovalent ions is critically necessary. A good model needs to simultaneously reproduce many properties of ions, including their structure, dynamics, solvation, and moreover both the interactions of these ions with each other in the crystal and in solution and the interactions of ions with other molecules. At present, the best force fields for biomolecules employ a simple additive, nonpolarizable, and pairwise potential for atomic interaction. In this work, we describe our efforts to build better models of the monovalent ions within the pairwise Coulombic and 6-12 Lennard-Jones framework, where the models are tuned to balance crystal and solution properties in Ewald simulations with specific choices of well-known water models. Although it has been clearly demonstrated that truly accurate treatments of ions will require inclusion of nonadditivity and polarizability (particularly with the anions) and ultimately even a quantum mechanical treatment, our goal was to simply push the limits of the additive treatments to see if a balanced model could be created. The applied methodology is general and can be extended to other ions and to polarizable force-field models. Our starting point centered on observations from long simulations of biomolecules in salt solution with the AMBER force fields where salt crystals formed well below their solubility limit. The likely cause of the artifact in the AMBER parameters relates to the naive mixing of the Smith and Dang chloride parameters with AMBER-adapted Aqvist cation parameters. To provide a more appropriate balance, we reoptimized the parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential for the ions and specific choices of water models. To validate and optimize the parameters, we calculated hydration free energies of the solvated ions and also lattice energies (LE) and lattice constants (LC) of alkali halide salt crystals. This is the first effort that systematically scans across the Lennard-Jones space (well depth and radius) while balancing ion properties like LE and LC across all pair combinations of the alkali ions and halide ions. The optimization across the entire monovalent series avoids systematic deviations. The ion parameters developed, optimized, and characterized were targeted for use with some of the most commonly used rigid and nonpolarizable water models, specifically TIP3P, TIP4P EW, and SPC/E. In addition to well reproducing the solution and crystal properties, the new ion parameters well reproduce binding energies of the ions to water and the radii of the first hydration shells.},

abstract = {We have investigated the rotational dynamics of hen egg white lysozyme in monodisperse aqueous solutions of concentrations up to 250 mg/mL, using a rigid-body Brownian dynamics method that accurately accounts for anisotropies of diffusing objects. We have examined the validity of the free diffusion concept in the analysis of computer simulations of volume-occupied molecular solutions. We have found that, when as the only intermolecular interaction, the excluded volume effect is considered, rotational diffusion of molecules adheres to the free diffusion model. Further, we present a method based on the exact (in the case of the free diffusion) analytic forms of autocorrelation functions of particular vectors rigidly attached to diffusing objects, which allows one to obtain from results of molecular simulations the three principal rotational diffusion coefficients characterizing rotational Brownian motion of an arbitrarily shaped rigid particle for an arbitrary concentration of crowders. We have applied this approach to trajectories resulting from Brownian dynamics simulations of hen egg white lysozyme solutions. We show that the apparent anisotropy of proteins' rotational motions increases with an increasing degree of crowding. Finally, we demonstrate that even if the hydrodynamic anisotropy of molecules is neglected and molecules are simulated using their average translational and rotational diffusion coefficients, excluded volume effects still lead to their anisotropic rotational dynamics.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18{\%} overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen–oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self‐diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

abstract = {Fast protein size-exclusion liquid chromatography (SEC-FPLC) was used to study solvent-induced unfolding of six proteins. Two of them (sperm whale myoglobin and hen white lysozyme) denature on the simple N (native){\textless}--{\textgreater}U (completely unfolded) scheme. The other four proteins [bovine and human alpha-lactalbumin, bovine carbonic anhydrase B (BCAB), and beta-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus] denature through the molten globule (MG) state (i.e., on the N{\textless}--{\textgreater}MG{\textless}--{\textgreater}U denaturation scheme). We have shown that the permeation properties of the Superose 12 columns are practically independent of temperature, pH, and denaturants in wide concentration intervals. In the case of myoglobin and lysozyme denaturation at 4 degrees C (when the exchange between the native and unfolded states is slower than the characteristic time of chromatography), a bimodal distribution on molecular dimensions in the transition region was observed. This indicates that, under denaturant action, protein molecules can only be in one of the two states with different compactness. In other words, this shows that FPLC is one of the most direct approaches to establish the "all-or-none" mechanism of the equilibrium solvent-induced denaturation of globular proteins. The curves of guanidinium hydrochloride- (GdmHCl) or urea-induced unfolding (N{\textless}--{\textgreater}U or MG{\textless}--{\textgreater}U transitions) of a protein on a column (monitored either by the relative areas of two peaks or--for fast exchange--by the position of the average peak) coincide with those monitored by far-UV CD in solution. The Stokes radius values obtained with the use of FPLC for the molten globule states of BCAB (1.6 M GdmHCl in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and acid form at pH 3.6) and for the human alpha-lactalbumin molten globule (2.0 M GdmHCl in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8) coincide with those known from literature. Thus, it has been shown that fast protein size-exclusion liquid chromatography (FPLC) is an "inert" technique, i.e., it does not shift the equilibrium between N, MG, and U states and, therefore, can be used for qualitative and quantitative studies of protein denaturation.},

The energy function used is comprised of van der Waals, Coulomb, and atomic contact energy terms. During the simulation, we gradually shift from a novel smoothed van der Waals potential, which prevents trapping in local energy minima, to the standard Lennard-Jones potential. Following the simulation, the conformations are clustered to obtain the final predictions. Using only the first 100 decoys generated by a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based rigid-body docking method, our refinement procedure is able to generate near-native structures (interface RMSD {\textless}2.5 A) as first model in 14 of 59 cases in a benchmark set. In most cases, clear binding funnels around the native structure can be observed. The results show the potential of Monte Carlo refinement methods and emphasize their applicability for protein-protein docking.},

In this work, we study endoglucanase Cel8A, which is a relevant enzymatic component of the cellulosomes of Clostridium thermocellum. We use both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations to investigate how the equilibrium conformations of the catalytic domain of Cel8A are affected by the disordered linker at its C terminus. We find that when the endoglucanase is bound to its substrate, the effective stiffness of the linker can influence the distances between groups of amino-acid residues throughout the entire enzymatic domain. In particular, variations in the linker stiffness can lead to small changes in the geometry of the active-site cleft. We suggest that such geometrical changes may, in turn, have an effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme.},

Recognition and transmission of monoubiquitin signals is mediated by a variety of ubiquitin-binding motifs such as UIM, UBA, UEV, VHS and CUE in endocytic proteins. The yeast Vps27 protein requires two UIMs for efficient interactions with ubiquitin and for sorting cargo into multivesicular bodies. Here we show that the individual UIMs of Vps27 exist as autonomously folded alpha-helices that bind ubiquitin independently, non-cooperatively and with modest affinity. The Vps27 N-terminal UIM engages the Leu8–Ile44–Val70 hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin through a helical surface conserved in UIMs of diverse proteins, including that of the S5a proteasomal regulatory subunit. The Leu8–Ile44–Val70 ubiquitin surface is also the site of interaction for CUE and UBA domains in endocytic proteins, consistent with the view that ubiquitin- binding endocytic proteins act serially on the same monoubiquitylated cargo during transport from cell surface to the lysosome.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter–atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently — those with short–range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed–memory parallel machine which allows for message–passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard–Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers—the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y–MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840–node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade–offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. This},

abstract = {Association of protein molecules constitutes the basis for the interaction network in a cell. Despite its fundamental importance, the thermodynamic aspect of protein-protein binding, particularly the issues relating to the entropy change upon binding, remains elusive. The binding of actin and myosin, which are vital proteins in motility, is a typical example, in which two different binding mechanisms have been argued: the binding affinity increases with increasing temperature and with decreasing salt-concentration, indicating the entropy-driven binding and the enthalpy-driven binding, respectively. How can these thermodynamically different binding mechanisms coexist? To address this question, which is of general importance in understanding protein-protein bindings, we conducted an in silico titration of the actin-myosin system by molecular dynamics simulation using a residue-level coarse-grained model, with particular focus on the role of the electrostatic interaction. We found a good agreement between in silico and in vitro experiments on the salt-concentration dependence and the temperature dependence of the binding affinity. We then figured out how the two binding mechanisms can coexist: the enthalpy (due to electrostatic interaction between actin and myosin) provides the basal binding affinity, and the entropy (due to the orientational disorder of water molecules) enhances it at higher temperatures. In addition, we analyzed the actin-myosin complex structures observed during the simulation and obtained a variety of weak-binding complex structures, among which were found an unusual binding mode suggested by an earlier experiment and precursor structures of the strong-binding complex proposed by electron microscopy. These results collectively indicate the potential capability of a residue-level coarse-grained model to simulate the association-dissociation dynamics (particularly for transient weak-bindings) exhibited by larger and more complicated systems, as in a cell.},

abstract = {The different roles {\~{}}he attractive and repulsive forces play in forming the equilibrium structure of a Lennard-Jones liquid are discussed. It is found that the effects of these forces are most easily separated by considering the structure factor (or equivalently, the Fourier transform of the pair-correlation func-tion) rather than the pair-correlation function itself. At intermediate and large wave vectors, the repulsive forces dominate the quantitative behavior of the liquid structure factor. The attractions are manifested primarily in the small wave vector part of the structure factor; but this effect decreases as the density increases and is almost negligible at reduced densities higher than 0.65. These conclusions are established by considering the structure factor of a hypothetical reference system in which the intermolecular forces are entirely repulsive and identical to the repulsive forces in a Lennard-Jones fluid. This reference system structure factor is calculated with the aid of a simple but accurate approximation described herein. The conclusions lead to a very simple prescription for calculating the radial distribution function of dense liquids which is more accurate than that obtained by any previously reported theory. The thermodynamic ramifications of the conclusions are presented in the form of calculations of the free energy, the internal energy (from the energy equation), and the pressure (from the virial equation). The implications of our conclusions to perturbation theories for liquids and to the interpretation of x-ray scattering experiments are discussed.},

Helix ??6 remains free in solution and does not appear to be part of the autoinhibitory complex.

abstract = {One studying the motion of fluids relative to particulate systems is soon impressed by the dichotomy which exists between books covering theoretical and practical aspects. Classical hydrodynamics is largely concerned with perfect fluids which unfortunately exert no forces on the particles past which they move. Practical approaches to subjects like fluidization, sedimentation, and flow through porous media abound in much useful but uncorrelated empirical information. The present book represents an attempt to bridge this gap by providing at least the beginnings of a rational approach to fluid particle dynamics, based on first principles. From the pedagogic viewpoint it seems worthwhile to show that the Navier-Stokes equations, which form the basis of all systematic texts, can be employed for useful practical applications beyond the elementary problems of laminar flow in pipes and Stokes law for the motion of a single particle. Although a suspension may often be viewed as a continuum for practical purposes, it really consists of a discrete collection of particles immersed in an essentially continuous fluid. Consideration of the actual detailed boundary value problems posed by this viewpoint may serve to call attention to the limitation of idealizations which apply to the overall transport properties of a mixture of fluid and solid particles.},

abstract = {Membraneless organelles important to intracellular compartmentalization have recently been shown to comprise assemblies of proteins which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest.},

Recognition and transmission of monoubiquitin signals is mediated by a variety of ubiquitin-binding motifs such as UIM, UBA, UEV, VHS and CUE in endocytic proteins. The yeast Vps27 protein requires two UIMs for efficient interactions with ubiquitin and for sorting cargo into multivesicular bodies. Here we show that the individual UIMs of Vps27 exist as autonomously folded alpha-helices that bind ubiquitin independently, non-cooperatively and with modest affinity. The Vps27 N-terminal UIM engages the Leu8–Ile44–Val70 hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin through a helical surface conserved in UIMs of diverse proteins, including that of the S5a proteasomal regulatory subunit. The Leu8–Ile44–Val70 ubiquitin surface is also the site of interaction for CUE and UBA domains in endocytic proteins, consistent with the view that ubiquitin- binding endocytic proteins act serially on the same monoubiquitylated cargo during transport from cell surface to the lysosome.},

This effective two-body force field is the successor to the Weiner et al. force field and was developed with some of the same philosophies, such as the use of a simple diagonal potential function and electrostatic potential fit atom centered charges. The need for a 10-12 function for representing hydrogen bonds is no longer necessary due to the improved performance of the new charge model and new van der Waals parameters. These new charges are determined using a 6-31G basis set and restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting and have been shown to reproduce interaction energies, free energies of solvation, and conformational energies of simple small molecules to a good degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the new RESP charges exhibit less variability as a function of the molecular conformation used in the charge determination. The new van der Waals parameters have been derived from liquid simulations and include hydrogen parameters which take into account the effects of any geminal electronegative atoms. The bonded parameters developed by Weiner et al. were modified as necessary to reproduce experimental vibrational frequencies and structures. Most of the simple dihedral parameters have been retained from Weiner et al., but a complex set of 4 and yj parameters which do a good job of reproducing the energies of the low-energy conformations of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides has been developed for the peptide backbone.},

abstract = {We construct coarse master equations for peptide folding dynamics from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. A maximum-likelihood propagator-based method allows us to extract accurate rates for the transitions between the different conformational states of the small helix-forming peptide Ala5. Assigning the conformational states by using transition paths instead of instantaneous molecular coordinates suppresses the effects of fast non-Markovian dynamics. The resulting master equations are validated by comparing their analytical correlation functions with those obtained directly from the molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the master equations properly capture the character and relaxation times of the entire spectrum of conformational relaxation processes. By using the eigenvectors of the transition rate matrix, we are able to systematically coarse-grain the system. We find that a two-state description, with a folded and an unfolded state, roughly captures the slow conformational dynamics. A four-state model, with two folded and two unfolded states, accurately recovers the three slowest relaxation process with time scales between 1.5 and 7 ns. The master equation models not only give access to the slow conformational dynamics but also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the helix-coil transition.},

abstract = {A new approach to the interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments on macromolecules in solution is presented. This paper deals with the theoretical foundations and establishes the range of validity of this approach, and the accompanying paper demonstrates how a wide variety of experimental relaxation data can be successfully analyzed by using this approach. For both isotropic and anisotropic overall motion, it is shown that the unique information on fast internal motions contained in relaxation experiments can be completely specified by two model-independent quantities: ( 1) a generalized order parameter, S, which is a measure of the spatial restriction of the motion, and (2) an effective correlation time, tau{\_}e, which is a measure of the rate of motion. A simple expression for the spectral density involving these two parameters is derived and is shown to be exact when the internal (but not overall) motions are in the extreme narrowing limit. The model-free approach (so called because S{\^{}}2 and tau{\_}e, have model-independent significance) consists of using the above spectral density to least-squares fit relaxation data by treating S{\^{}}2 and tau{\_}e, as adjustable parameters. The range of validity of this approach is illustrated by analyzing error-free relaxation data generated by using sophisticated dynamical models. Empirical rules are presented that allow one to estimate the accuracy of S{\^{}}2 and tau{\_}e. extracted by using the model-free approach by considering their numerical values, the resonance frequencies, and the parameters for the overall motion. For fast internal motions, it is unnecessary to use approaches based on complicated spectral densities derived within the framework of a model because all models that can give the correct value of S{\^{}}2 work equally well. The unique dynamic information (S and tau{\_}e) can be easily extracted by using the model-free approach. Moreover, if one desires a physical picture of the motion, the numerical values of S{\^{}}2 and tau{\_}e can be readily interpreted within a physically reasonable model.},

We study the folding of Rhodanese in GroEL, using coarse-grained molecular simulations of the complete system including chaperonin and substrate protein. We find that, by approximating the substrate:GroEL interactions as repulsive, we obtain a strong acceleration in rate of between one and two orders of magnitude; a similar result is obtained by representing the chaperonin as a simple spherical cavity. Remarkably, however, we find that using a carefully parameterized, sequence-based potential to capture specific residue-residue interactions between Rhodanese and the GroEL cavity walls induces a very strong reduction of the folding rates. The effect of the interactions is large enough to completely offset the effects of confinement, such that folding in some cases can be even slower than that of the unconfined protein. The origin of the slowdown appears to be stabilization - relative to repulsive confinement - of the unfolded state through binding to the cavity walls, rather than a reduction of the diffusion coefficient along the folding coordinate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The study of solutions of biomacromolecules provides an important basis for understanding the behavior of many fundamental cellular processes, such as protein folding, self-assembly, biochemical reactions, and signal transduction. Here, we describe a Brownian dynamics simulation procedure and its validation for the study of the dynamic and structural properties of protein solutions. In the model used, the proteins are treated as atomically detailed rigid bodies moving in a continuum solvent. The protein-protein interaction forces are described by the sum of electrostatic interaction, electrostatic desolvation, nonpolar desolvation, and soft-core repulsion terms. The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved to compute electrostatic terms. Simulations of homogeneous solutions of three different proteins with varying concentrations, pH, and ionic strength were performed. The results were compared to experimental data and theoretical values in terms of long-time self-diffusion coefficients, second virial coefficients, and structure factors. The results agree with the experimental trends and, in many cases, experimental values are reproduced quantitatively. There are no parameters specific to certain protein types in the interaction model, and hence the model should be applicable to the simulation of the behavior of mixtures of macromolecules in cell-like crowded environments. ?? 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The stability changes caused by single amino acid substitutions are studied by a simple, empirical method which takes account of the free energy change in the compact denatured state as well as in the native state. The conformational free energy is estimated from effective inter-residue contact energies, as evaluated in our previous study. When this method is applied, with a simple assumption about the compactness of the denatured state, for single amino acid replacements at Glu49 of the tryptophan synthase alpha subunit and at Ile3 of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, the estimates of the unfolding Gibbs free energy changes correlate well with observed values, especially for hydrophobic amino acids, and it also yields the same magnitudes of energy as the observed values for both proteins. When it is also applied for amino acid replacements at various positions to estimate the average number of contacts at each position in the denatured state from the observed value of unfolding free energy change, those values for replacements with Gly and Ala at the same residue position in staphylococcal nuclease correlate well with each other. The estimated numbers of contacts indicate that the protein is not fully expanded in the denatured state and also that the compact denatured state may have a substantially native-like topology, like the molten globule state, in that there is a weak correlation between the estimated average number of contacts at each residue position in the denatured state and the number of contacts in the native structure. These results provide some further evidence that the inter-residue contact energies as applied here (i) properly reflect actual inter-residue interactions and (ii) can be considered to be a pairwise hydrophobicity scale. Also, the results indicate that characterization of the denatured state is critical to understanding the folding process.},

Colloid Interface Sci. 36, 97 (1971)] and more recently Heyes [Mol. Phys. 87, 287 (1996)] proposed different analytical forms for the diffusion constant. While the formalism of Honig et al. strictly applies to a binary collision, the one from Heyes accounts for the dependence of the diffusion constant on the local concentration of particles. However, the analytical expression of the latter approach is more complex and depends on the particular characteristics of each system. Here we report a combined methodology, which incorporates the formula of Honig et al. at very short distances and a simple local volume-fraction correction at longer separations. As will be shown, the flocculation behavior calculated from Brownian dynamics simulations employing the present technique, is found to be similar to that of Batchelor's tensor [J. Fluid. Mech. 74, 1 (1976); 119, 379 (1982)]. However, it corrects the anomalous coalescence found in concentrated systems as a result of the overestimation of many-body HI.},

We prove that the quaternion method is equivalent to the well-known formula due to Kabsch. We analyze the various cases that may arise, and give a complete enumeration of the special cases in terms of the arrangement of the eigenvalues of a traceless, 4 x 4 symmetric matrix. A key result here is an expression for the gradient of the RMSD as a function of model parameters. This can be useful, for example, in finding the minimum energy path of a reaction using the elastic band methods or in optimizing model parameters to best fit a target structure.},

The relative ratio of the principal components of the inertia tensor calculated from the X-ray structure is 1.00:0.90:0.64, and the axis with the smallest inertia component makes an angle of 11 degrees with the unique axis of the experimentally determined diffusion tenser. Hydrodynamic calculations agree well with experimental results, provided half a shell of bound water is included and flexibility of the C-terminal residues is accounted for either by omitting them from the calculations or by using conformations for these residues obtained from a Langevin dynamics simulation.},

Thus, the method is suited to study the rotational diffusion of macromolecules having rotational diffusion times of dozens to hundreds of nanoseconds, which is considerably larger than the fluorescence lifetime of most commercially available dyes or auto-fluorescent proteins. A pulsed interleaved excitation scheme with crossed excitation polarization maximizes the time-dependent amplitude of the measured correlation curve as caused by rotational diffusion. Using the determined rotational diffusion coefficient, precise values of the hydrodynamic radius can be obtained. The method is exemplified on sizing a set of common globular proteins.},

Here we show that with replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), one can not only sample equilibrium properties, but also extract kinetic information. For systems that strictly obey first-order kinetics, the procedure to extract rates is rigorous. For actual molecular systems whose long-time dynamics is captured by kinetic rate models, accurate rate coefficients can be determined from the statistics of the transitions between the metastable states at each replica temperatures.

It appears that TIP5P-Ew is the best potential to predict the trend of the thermal conductivity. Both five-site models can accurately predict shear viscosity values as well as its trends along with temperature. Three-site model (TIP3P) has better performance in calculating specific heats. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we combine PELDOR experiments with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to arrive at an atomistic view of the conformational dynamics of DNA. The MD simulations closely reproduce the PELDOR time traces, and demonstrate that bending, in addition to twist-stretch motions, underpin the sub-$\mu$s dynamics of DNA. PELDOR experiments correctly rank DNA force fields and resolve subtle differences in the conformational ensembles of nucleic acids, on the order of 1–2 {\AA}. Long-range distance and angle measurements with rigid spin labels provide critical input for the refinement of computer models and the elucidation of the structure and dynamics of complex biomolecules.},

abstract = {The cellulosome is a multi-enzyme machinery which efficiently degrades plant cell-wall polysaccharides. The multiple domains of the cellulosome complexes are often tethered to one another by intrinsically disordered regions. The properties and functions of these disordered linkers are unknown to a large extent. In this work, we study the conformational variability of one component of the cellulosome - the multi-domain xylanase Z (XynZ) of Clostridium thermocellum. We use a coarse-grained protein model to efficiently simulate conformations of the enzyme. Our simulation results are in excellent agreement with data from small angle X-ray scattering experiments, which validates the simulation outcome. Both in the presence and absence of the cohesin domain, the XynZ enzyme appears to be flexible in the sense that it takes various compact and extended conformations. The physical interactions between the individual domains are rather weak and transient, and the XynZ enzyme is held together mainly by the flexible linkers connecting the domains. The end-to-end distance distributions for the flexible linkers can be rationalized by the excluded volume effect. Taken together, our results provide a detailed picture of the conformational ensemble of the XynZ enzyme in solution.},

We show how a formal series expansion of the invariant measure of a Langevin dynamics numerical method can be obtained in a straightforward way using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff lemma. We then compare Langevin dynamics integrators in terms of their invariant distributions and demonstrate a superconvergence property (4th order accuracy where only 2nd order would be expected) of one method in the high friction limit; this method, moreover, can be reduced to a simple modification of the Euler-Maruyama method for Brownian dynamics involving a non-Markovian (coloured noise) random process. In the Brownian dynamics case, 2nd order accuracy of the invariant density is achieved. All methods considered are efficient for molecular applications (requiring one force evaluation per timestep) and of a simple form. In fully resolved (long run) molecular dynamics simulations, for our favoured method, we observe up to two orders of magnitude improvement in configurational sampling accuracy for given stepsize with no evident reduction in the size of the largest usable timestep compared to common alternative methods.},

abstract = {Single molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments are used to infer the properties of the denatured state ensemble (DSE) of proteins. From the measured average FRET efficiency, {\textless}E{\textgreater}, the distance distribution P(R) is inferred by assuming that the DSE can be described as a polymer. The single parameter in the appropriate polymer model (Gaussian chain, wormlike chain, or self-avoiding walk) for P(R) is determined by equating the calculated and measured {\textless}E{\textgreater}. In order to assess the accuracy of this "standard procedure," we consider the generalized Rouse model (GRM), whose properties [{\textless}E{\textgreater} and P(R)] can be analytically computed, and the Molecular Transfer Model for protein L for which accurate simulations can be carried out as a function of guanadinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) concentration. Using the precisely computed {\textless}E{\textgreater} for the GRM and protein L, we infer P(R) using the standard procedure. We find that the mean end-to-end distance can be accurately inferred (less than 10{\%} relative error) using {\textless}E{\textgreater} and polymer models for P(R). However, the value extracted for the radius of gyration (R(g)) and the persistence length (l(p)) are less accurate. For protein L, the errors in the inferred properties increase as the GdmCl concentration increases for all polymer models. The relative error in the inferred R(g) and l(p), with respect to the exact values, can be as large as 25{\%} at the highest GdmCl concentration. We propose a self-consistency test, requiring measurements of {\textless}E{\textgreater} by attaching dyes to different residues in the protein, to assess the validity of describing DSE using the Gaussian model. Application of the self-consistency test to the GRM shows that even for this simple model, which exhibits an order--{\textgreater}disorder transition, the Gaussian P(R) is inadequate. Analysis of experimental data of FRET efficiencies with dyes at several locations for the cold shock protein, and simulations results for protein L, for which accurate FRET efficiencies between various locations were computed, shows that at high GdmCl concentrations there are significant deviations in the DSE P(R) from the Gaussian model.},

To encourage applications, the model is kept very simple. Only a small number of coarse grained atom types are defined, which interact using a few discrete levels of interaction. Despite the computational speed and the simplistic nature of the model, it proves to be both versatile in its applications and accurate in its predictions.

The study is carried out comparatively for two homologous carbamoyltransferases, a natively-knotted N-acetylornithine carbamoyltransferase (AOTCase) and an unknotted ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase). In addition, two different sets of pairwise amino acid interactions are considered: one promoting exclusively native interactions, and the other additionally including non-native quasi-chemical and electrostatic interactions. With the former model neither protein shows a propensity to form knots. With the additional non-native interactions, knotting propensity remains negligible for the natively-unknotted OTCase while for AOTCase it is much enhanced. Analysis of the trajectories suggests that the different entanglement of the two transcarbamylases follows from the tendency of the C-terminal to point away from (for OTCase) or approach and eventually thread (for AOTCase) other regions of partly-folded protein. The analysis of the OTCase/AOTCase pair clarifies that natively-knotted proteins can spontaneously knot during early folding stages and that non-native sequence-dependent interactions are important for promoting and disfavouring early knotting events.},

abstract = {Macromolecular crowding in cells is recognized to have a significant impact on biological function, yet quantitative models for its effects are relatively undeveloped. The influence of crowding on protein-protein interactions is of particular interest, since these mediate many processes in the cell, including the self-assembly of larger complexes, recognition, and signaling. We use a residue-level coarse-grained model to investigate the effects of macromolecular crowding on the assembly of protein-protein complexes. Interactions between the proteins are treated using a fully transferable energy function, and interactions of protein residues with the spherical crowders are repulsive. We show that the binding free energy for two protein complexes, ubiquitin/UIM1 and cytochrome c/cytochrome c peroxidase, decreases modestly as the concentration of crowding agents increases. To obtain a quantitative description of the stabilizing effect, we map the aspherical individual proteins and protein complexes onto spheres whose radii are calculated from the crowder-excluded protein volumes. With this correspondence, we find that the change in the binding free energy due to crowding can be quantitatively described by the scaled particle theory model without any fitting parameters. The effects of a mixture of different-size crowders-as would be found in a real cell-are predicted by the same model with an additivity ansatz. We also obtain the remarkable result that crowding increases the fraction of specific complexes at the expense of nonspecific transient encounter complexes in a crowded environment. This result, due to the greater excluded volume of the nonspecific complexes, demonstrates that macromolecular crowding can have subtle functional effects beyond the relative stability of bound and unbound complexes.},

Until the initial publication of this work, however, no monograph treated the principles behind current developments in the field.This volume presents a comprehensive introduction to the principles underlying laser light scattering, focusing on the time dependence of fluctuations in fluid systems; it also serves as an introduction to the theory of time correlation functions, with chapters on projection operator techniques in statistical mechanics. The first half comprises most of the material necessary for an elementary understanding of the applications to the study of macromolecules, or comparable sized particles in fluids, and to the motility of microorganisms. The study of collective (or many particle) effects constitutes the second half, including more sophisticated treatments of macromolecules in solution and most of the applications of light scattering to the study of fluids containing small molecules.With its wide-ranging discussions of the many applications of light scattering, this text will be of interest to research chemists, physicists, biologists, medical and fluid mechanics researchers, engineers, and graduate students in these areas.},

abstract = {Distributions of each amino acid in the trans-membrane domain were calculated as a function of the membrane normal using all currently available alpha-helical membrane protein structures with resolutions better than 4 A. The results were compared with previous sequence- and structure-based analyses. Calculation of the average hydrophobicity along the membrane normal demonstrated that the protein surface in the membrane domain is in fact much more hydrophobic than the protein core. While hydrophobic residues dominate the membrane domain, the interfacial regions of membrane proteins were found to be abundant in the small residues glycine, alanine, and serine, consistent with previous studies on membrane protein packing. Charged residues displayed nonsymmetric distributions with a preference for the intracellular interface. This effect was more prominent for Arg and Lys resulting in a direct confirmation of the positive inside rule. Potentials of mean force along the membrane normal were derived for each amino acid by fitting Gaussian functions to the residue distributions. The individual potentials agree well with experimental and theoretical considerations. The resulting implicit membrane potential was tested on various membrane proteins as well as single trans-membrane alpha-helices. All membrane proteins were found to be at an energy minimum when correctly inserted into the membrane. For alpha-helices both interfacial (i.e. surface bound) and inserted configurations were found to correspond to energy minima. The results demonstrate that the use of trans-membrane amino acid distributions to derive an implicit membrane representation yields meaningful residue potentials.},

abstract = {Brownian Dynamics algorithms are widely used for simulating soft-matter and biochemical systems. In recent times, their application has been extended to the simulation of coarse-grained models of cellular networks in simple organisms. In these models, components move by diffusion, and can react with one another upon contact. However, when reactions are incorporated into a Brownian Dynamics algorithm, attention must be paid to avoid violations of the detailed-balance rule, and therefore introducing systematic errors in the simulation. We present a Brownian Dynamics algorithm for reaction-diffusion systems that rigorously obeys detailed balance for equilibrium reactions. By comparing the simulation results to exact analytical results for a bimolecular reaction, we show that the algorithm correctly reproduces both equilibrium and dynamical quantities. We apply our scheme to a ``push-pull'' network in which two antagonistic enzymes covalently modify a substrate. Our results highlight that the diffusive behaviour of the reacting species can reduce the gain of the response curve of this network.},

abstract = {Analysis of extended molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lysozyme in vacuo and in aqueous solution reveals that it is possible to separate the configurational space into two subspaces: (1) an "essential" subspace containing only a few degrees of freedom in which anharmonic motion occurs that comprises most of the positional fluctuations; and (2) the remaining space in which the motion has a narrow Gaussian distribution and which can be considered as "physically constrained." If overall translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid over several hundred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the positional deviations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations. The near-constraint behavior of the latter subspace allows the separation of equations of motion and promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and performing dynamic simulations only in this reduced space.},

abstract = {Pulse field gradient NMR methods have been used to determine the effective hydrodynamic radii of a range of native and nonnative protein conformations. From these experimental data, empirical relationships between the measured hydrodynamic radius (R(h)) and the number of residues in the polypeptide chain (N) have been established; for native folded proteins R(h) = 4.75N (0.29)A and for highly denatured states R(h) = 2.21N (0.57)A. Predictions from these equations agree well with experimental data from dynamic light scattering and small-angle X-ray or neutron scattering studies reported in the literature for proteins ranging in size from 58 to 760 amino acid residues. The predicted values of the hydrodynamic radii provide a framework that can be used to analyze the conformational properties of a range of nonnative states of proteins. Several examples are given here to illustrate this approach including data for partially structured molten globule states and for proteins that are unfolded but biologically active under physiological conditions. These reveal evidence for significant coupling between local and global features of the conformational ensembles adopted in such states. In particular, the effective dimensions of the polypeptide chain are found to depend significantly on the level of persistence of regions of secondary structure or features such as hydrophobic clusters within a conformational ensemble.},

abstract = {We report on atomistic simulation of the folding of a natively-knotted protein, MJ0366, based on a realistic force field. To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported effort where a realistic force field is used to investigate the folding pathways of a protein with complex native topology. By using the dominant-reaction pathway scheme we collected about 30 successful folding trajectories for the 82-amino acid long trefoil-knotted protein. Despite the dissimilarity of their initial unfolded configuration, these trajectories reach the natively-knotted state through a remarkably similar succession of steps. In particular it is found that knotting occurs essentially through a threading mechanism, involving the passage of the C-terminal through an open region created by the formation of the native [Formula: see text]-sheet at an earlier stage. The dominance of the knotting by threading mechanism is not observed in MJ0366 folding simulations using simplified, native-centric models. This points to a previously underappreciated role of concerted amino acid interactions, including non-native ones, in aiding the appropriate order of contact formation to achieve knotting.},

@article{Song2017,
abstract = {A mathematico-physically valid formulation is required to infer properties of disordered protein conformations from single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET). Conformational dimensions inferred by conventional approaches that presume a homogeneous conformational ensemble can be unphysical. When all possible—heterogeneous as well as homogeneous—conformational distributions are taken into account without prejudgment, a single value of average transfer efficiency 〈E〉 between dyes at two chain ends is generally consistent with highly diverse, multiple values of the average radius of gyration 〈Rg〉. Here we utilize unbiased conformational statistics from a coarse-grained explicit-chain model to establish a general logical framework to quantify this fundamental ambiguity in smFRET inference. As an application, we address the long-standing controversy regarding the denaturant dependence of 〈Rg〉 of unfolded proteins, focusing on Protein L as an example. Conventional smFRET inference concluded that 〈Rg〉 of unfolded Protein L is highly sensitive to [GuHCl], but data from SAXS suggested a near-constant 〈Rg〉 irrespective of [GuHCl]. Strikingly, our analysis indicates that although the reported 〈E〉 values for Protein L at [GuHCl] = 1 and 7 M are very different at 0.75 and 0.45, respectively, the Bayesian Rg2distributions consistent with these two 〈E〉 values overlap by as much as 75{\%}. Our findings suggest, in general, that the smFRET-SAXS discrepancy regarding unfolded protein dimensions likely arise from highly heterogeneous conformational ensembles at low or zero denaturant, and that additional experimental probes are needed to ascertain the nature of this heterogeneity.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamic properties of macromolecules and bioparticles, represented by bead models, can be calculated using methods implemented in the computer routine HYDRO. Recently, a new computer routine, SOLPRO, has been presented for the calculation of various SOLution PROperties. These include (1) time-dependent electro-optic and spectroscopic properties related to rotational diffusion, (2) non-dynamic properties like scattering curves, and (3) dimensionless quantities that combine two or more solution properties in a form which depends on the shape of the macromolecule but not on its size. In the present work we describe the inclusion of more of those types of properties in a new version of SOLPRO. Particularly, we describe the calculation of relaxation rates in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). For dipolar coupling, given the direction of the dipole the program calculates values of the spectral density, from which the NMR relaxation times can be obtained. We also consider scattering-related properties, namely the distribution of distances for the bead model, which is directly related to the angular dependence of scattered intensity, and the particle's longest distance. We have devised and programmed a procedure to calculate the covolume of the bead model, related to the second virial coefficient and, in general, to the concentration dependence of solution properties. Various shape-dependent dimensionless quantities involving the covolume are calculated. In this paper we also discuss some aspects, namely bead overlapping and hydration, that are not explicitly included in SOLPRO, but should be considered by the user.},

Here, we examine rotational diffusion in four small, globular proteins (ubiquitin, binase, lysozyme, and fragment B3 of protein G) with the TIP3P, TIP4P/EW, and SPC/E water models, in simulations that are 6 to 60 times as long as the mean rotational tumbling time. We describe a method for extracting diffusion tensors from such simulations and compare the results to experimental values extracted from NMR relaxation measurements. The simulation results accurately follow a diffusion equation, even for spherical harmonic correlation functions with l as large as 8. However, the best-fit tensors are significantly different from experiment, especially for the commonly used TIP3P water model. Simulations that are 20 to 100 times longer than the rotational tumbling times are needed for good statistics. A number of residues exhibit internal motions on the nanosecond time scale, but in all cases examined here, a product of internal and overall time-correlation functions matches the total time-correlation function well.},

Recent modifications to the Amber and CHARMM protein force fields, for example, have improved the backbone torsion potentials, remedying deficiencies in earlier versions. Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond-timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side-chain conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber ff99SB-ILDN, exhibits considerably better agreement with the NMR data.},

abstract = {It has been shown that massed stimulation (MS) of the amygdala or hippocampus does not result in seizure progression but in the 'phenomenon of adaptation', whereas alternate day rapid kindling (ADRK) produces reliable kindling (Lothman, E.W., Williamson, J.M., 1994. Brain Res. 649, 71-84). The goal of the present experiment was to determine if the two different effects are due to differences in mossy fiber sprouting and/or different seizure and postictal spike propagation patterns. Nine rats underwent MS (66-70 stimulations separated by 5-min interstimulus interval), six were exposed to ADRK (12 stimulations/day, every 30 min, with 4 stimulus days, each separated by 1 stimulus-free day), five rats served as control. All rats had electrodes implanted bilaterally in dorsal and ventral hippocampi (VH) and 14 of them had additional electrodes in the piriform cortex. Animals were stimulated in the left VH at afterdischarge threshold. There was no potentiation in seizure response 4-7 weeks after MS. In contrast, ADRK produced not only kindling but also ongoing epileptogenesis resulting 4-7 weeks later in spontaneous seizures and development of a prolonged convulsive state in response to the initially subconvulsive stimulus. Epileptiform activity during MS was mostly restricted to VH, whereas during ADRK it spread widely among studied structures including piriform cortex. Afterdischarges during MS were elicited frequently but seizures did not progress beyond stage 2-3. During ADRK, afterdischarges were evoked less frequently but seizures reached stage 4-7 by the end of the 3rd and 4th stimulus days. The fully kindled state was not reached at this time, but epileptogenic changes continued to progress. Seven weeks after the initial stimulation, both groups demonstrated mossy fiber sprouting of similar intensity in VH. We suggest, (1) frequent but predominantly local hippocampal afterdischarges induce mossy fiber sprouting, but this is not sufficient to produce significant enhancement in seizure susceptibility, and (2) the involvement of extra-hippocampal structures, possibly piriform cortex, and formation of an aberrant hippocampal-para-hippocampal circuit is required to result in a condition of progressive epileptogenesis.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary Intramolecular motions on ps-ns time scales in proteins in solution can be characterized by heteronuclear laboratory frame spin relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using established experimental protocols. The relaxation rate constants depend on the spectral density functions that quantify the frequency dependence of stochastic motions modulating the dipolar, chemical shift anisotropy (CSA), or quadrupolar interactions. The relaxation data are interpreted in terms of overall rotational diffusion of the molecule and intramolecular dynamics at specific atomic sites. Important applications of these methods have emerged for characterizing conformational entropy in proteins. This chapter focuses on a subset of 13C and 15N heteronuclear ZZexchange, Carr–PurcellMeiboom–Gill (CPMG), and R1$\rho$15 relaxation techniques that are sensitive to molecular motions or chemical kinetic processes on $\mu$s–ms time scales. Line-shape analysis or dynamic {\{}NMR{\}} is an established technique for investigating $\mu$s–ms time scale kinetic processes in solution. However, heteronuclear 2H, 13C, and 15N spectra of macromolecules usually are recorded in an indirect dimension of multidimensional proton-detected {\{}NMR{\}} experiments and the limited digital resolution hinders line-shape analysis. Consequently, ZZ-exchange, CPMG, and R1$\rho$ spin relaxation techniques are preferable for the investigation of dynamic processes in proteins using heteronuclear {\{}NMR{\}} spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III$\beta$ (PI4KB) is responsible for the synthesis of the Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN) pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phospahte (PI4P). PI4P is the defining lipid hallmark of Golgi and TGN and also serves as a signaling lipid and as a precursor for higher phosphoinositides. In addition, PI4KB is hijacked by many single stranded plus RNA (+RNA) viruses to generate PI4P-rich membranes that serve as viral replication organelles. Given the importance of this enzyme in cells, it has to be regulated. 14-3-3 proteins bind PI4KB upon its phosphorylation by protein kinase D, however, the structural basis of PI4KB recognition by 14-3-3 proteins is unknown. Here, we characterized the PI4KB:14-3-3 protein complex biophysically and structurally. We discovered that the PI4KB:14-3-3 protein complex is tight and is formed with 2:2 stoichiometry. Surprisingly, the enzymatic activity of PI4KB is not directly modulated by 14-3-3 proteins. However, 14-3-3 proteins protect PI4KB from proteolytic degradation in vitro. Our structural analysis revealed that the PI4KB:14-3-3 protein complex is flexible but mostly within the disordered regions connecting the 14-3-3 binding site of the PI4KB with the rest of the PI4KB enzyme. It also predicted no direct modulation of PI4KB enzymatic activity by 14-3-3 proteins and that 14-3-3 binding will not interfere with PI4KB recruitment to the membrane by the ACBD3 protein. In addition, the structural analysis explains the observed protection from degradation; it revealed that several disordered regions of PI4KB become protected from proteolytical degradation upon 14-3-3 binding. All the structural predictions were subsequently biochemically validated.},

To elucidate the effect of intermolecular interactions on Brownian motion of proteins, we performed (1)H pulsed-field gradient NMR and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) experiments combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and viscosity measurements for three proteins, alphaB-crystalline (alphaBc), bovine serum albumin, and hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) in aqueous solution. Our results demonstrate that long-time translational diffusion quantitatively follows the expected increase of macro-viscosity upon increasing the protein concentration in all cases, while rotational diffusion as assessed by polarized FCS and previous multi-frequency (1)H NMR relaxometry experiments reveals protein-specific behavior spanning the full range between the limiting cases of full decoupling from (alphaBc) and full coupling to (HEWL) the macro-viscosity. SAXS was used to study the interactions between the proteins in solution, whereby it is shown that the three cases cover the range between a weakly interacting hard-sphere system (alphaBc) and screened Coulomb repulsion combined with short-range attraction (HEWL). Our results, as well as insights from the recent literature, suggest that the unusual rotational-translational coupling may be due to anisotropic interactions originating from hydrodynamic shape effects combined with high charge and possibly a patchy charge distribution.},

These reduced dynamical models are constructed by matching the time-dependent occupancy-number correlation functions of the superstates in the full and aggregated systems. Identical results are obtained by using a projection operator formalism. The reduced dynamic models are exact for all times in their full non-Markovian formulation. In the approximate Markovian limit, we derive simple analytic expressions for the reduced rate or Markov transition matrices that lead to exact auto- and cross-relaxation times. These reduced Markovian models strike an optimal balance between matching the dynamics at short and long times. We also discuss how this approach can be used in a hierarchical procedure of constructing optimal superstates through aggregation of microstates. The results of the general reduced-matrix theory are illustrated with applications to simple model systems and a more complex master-equation model of peptide folding derived previously from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the reduced models faithfully capture the dynamics of the full systems, producing substantial improvements over the common local-equilibrium approximation.},

Here, we describe a theoretical simulation pipeline to study protein-protein association from an energy landscape perspective. First, a coarse-grained model is implemented and its applications are demonstrated via molecular dynamics simulations for several protein complexes. Second, an enhanced search method is used to efficiently sample a broad range of protein conformations. Third, multiple conformations are identified and clustered from simulation data and further projected on a three-dimensional globe specifying protein orientations and interacting energies. Results from several complexes indicate that the crystal-like conformation is favorable on the energy landscape even if the landscape is relatively rugged with metastable conformations. A closer examination on molecular forces shows that the formation of associated protein complexes can be primarily electrostatics-driven, hydrophobics-driven, or a combination of both in stabilizing specific binding interfaces. Taken together, these results suggest that the coarse-grained simulations and analyses provide an alternative toolset to study protein-protein association occurring in functional biomolecular complexes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Biophysical Society.},

Here, we show that, with replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), one can not only sample equilibrium properties but also extract kinetic information. For systems that strictly obey first-order kinetics, the procedure to extract rates is rigorous. For actual molecular systems whose long-time dynamics are captured by kinetic rate models, accurate rate coefficients can be determined from the statistics of the transitions between the metastable states at each replica temperature.

abstract = {Conformational transitions underlie the function of many biomolecular systems. Resolving intermediate structural changes, however, is challenging for both experiments and all-atom simulations because the duration of transitions is short relative to the lifetime of the stable species. Simplified descriptions based on a single experimental structure, such as elastic network models or G?? models, are not immediately applicable. Here, we develop a general method that combines multiple coarse-grained models to capture slow conformational transitions. Individually, each model describes one of the experimental structures; together, they approximate the complete energy surface. We demonstrate the method for the helix-to-sheet transition in Arc repressor N11L. We find that the transition involves the partial unfolding of the switch region, and rapid refolding into the alternate structure. Transient local unfolding is consistent with the low hydrogen exchange protection factors of the switch region. Also in agreement with experiment, the isomerization occurs independently of the global folding/dimerization transition. ??2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

The study is carried out comparatively for two homologous carbamoyltransferases, a natively-knotted N-acetylornithine carbamoyltransferase (AOTCase) and an unknotted ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTCase). In addition, two different sets of pairwise amino acid interactions are considered: one promoting exclusively native interactions, and the other additionally including non-native quasi-chemical and electrostatic interactions. With the former model neither protein shows a propensity to form knots. With the additional non-native interactions, knotting propensity remains negligible for the natively-unknotted OTCase while for AOTCase it is much enhanced. Analysis of the trajectories suggests that the different entanglement of the two transcarbamylases follows from the tendency of the C-terminal to point away from (for OTCase) or approach and eventually thread (for AOTCase) other regions of partly-folded protein. The analysis of the OTCase/AOTCase pair clarifies that natively-knotted proteins can spontaneously knot during early folding stages and that non-native sequence-dependent interactions are important for promoting and disfavouring early knotting events.},

abstract = {Assembly of protein complexes like virus shells, the centriole, the nuclear pore complex or the actin cytoskeleton is strongly determined by their spatial structure. Moreover it is becoming increasingly clear that the reversible nature of protein assembly is also an essential element for their biological function. Here we introduce a computational approach for the Brownian dynamics of patchy particles with anisotropic assemblies and fully reversible reactions. Different particles stochastically associate and dissociate with microscopic reaction rates depending on their relative spatial positions. The translational and rotational diffusive properties of all protein complexes are evaluated on-the-fly. Because we focus on reversible assembly, we introduce a scheme which ensures detailed balance for patchy particles. We then show how the macroscopic rates follow from the microscopic ones. As an instructive example, we study the assembly of a pentameric ring structure, for which we find excellent agreement between simulation results and a macroscopic kinetic description without any adjustable parameters. This demonstrates that our approach correctly accounts for both the diffusive and reactive processes involved in protein assembly.},

abstract = {Here we extend the ability to predict hydrodynamic coefficients and other solution properties of rigid macromolecular structures from atomic-level structures, implemented in the computer program HYDROPRO, to models with lower, residue-level resolution. Whereas in the former case there is one bead per nonhydrogen atom, the latter contains one bead per amino acid (or nucleotide) residue, thus allowing calculations when atomic resolution is not available or coarse-grained models are preferred. We parameterized the effective hydrodynamic radius of the elements in the atomic- and residue-level models using a very large set of experimental data for translational and rotational coefficients (intrinsic viscosity and radius of gyration) for {\textgreater}50 proteins. We also extended the calculations to very large proteins and macromolecular complexes, such as the whole 70S ribosome. We show that with proper parameterization, the two levels of resolution yield similar and rather good agreement with experimental data. The new version of HYDROPRO, in addition to considering various computational and modeling schemes, is far more efficient computationally and can be handled with the use of a graphical interface. {\textcopyright} 2011 Biophysical Society.},

For a neat Lennard-Jones fluid in flat rectangular boxes, diffusion becomes anisotropic, diverging logarithmically in all three directions with increasing box width. In elongated boxes, the diffusion coefficients normal to the long axis diverge linearly with the height-to-width ratio. For both lipid membranes and neat fluids, this behavior is predicted quantitatively by hydrodynamic theory.

It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

We describe the design, optimization, validation, and benchmarking of our algorithms, particularly the parallelization strategy, which is specific to the requirements of GPU hardware. Performance evaluation of our hybrid implementation shows scaled speedup as compared to a single-core CPU; reference simulations of small 100 residue proteins have a modest speedup of 4, while large simulations with thousands of residues are up to 1400 times faster. Importantly, the combination of coarse-grained models with highly parallel GPU hardware vastly increases the length- and time-scales accessible for protein simulation, making it possible to simulate much larger systems of interacting proteins than have previously been attempted. As a first step toward the simulation of the assembly of an entire viral capsid, we have demonstrated that the chosen coarse-grained model, together with REMC sampling, is capable of identifying the correctly bound structure, for a pair of fragments from the human hepatitis B virus capsid. Our parallel solution can easily be generalized to other interaction functions and other types of macromolecules and has implications for the parallelization of similar N-body problems that require random access lookups.},

The coarse-grained representations of the individual antibodies are constructed using an elastic network normal-mode analysis. Two different models are constructed for each antibody for a compact Y-shaped and an extended Y-shaped configuration. The resulting simulations of these coarse-grained antibodies that interact through screened electrostatics are done at six different concentrations. It is observed that a particular monoclonal antibody (hereafter referred to as MAb1) forms three-dimensional heterogeneous structures with dense regions or clusters compared to a different monoclonal antibody (hereafter referred to as MAb2) that forms more homogeneous structures (no clusters). These structures, together with the potential mean force (PMF) and radial distribution functions (RDF) between pairs of coarse-grained regions on the MAbs, are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observation that MAb1 has a significantly higher viscosity compared to MAb2, especially at concentrations {\textgreater}50 mg/mL, even though the only difference between the MAbs lies with a few amino acids at the antigen-binding loops (CDRs). It is also observed that the structures in MAb1 are formed due to stronger Fab-Fab interactions in corroboration with experimental observations. Evidence is also shown that Fab-Fc interactions can be equally important in addition to Fab-Fab interactions. The coarse-grained representations are effective in picking up differences based on local charge distributions of domains and make predictions on the self-association characteristics of these protein solutions. This is the first computational study of its kind to show that there are differences in structures formed by two different monoclonal antibodies at high concentrations.},

abstract = {The contribution of orientational relaxation to the tensor components of the third-order nonlinear polarization is evaluated for off-resonance Raman and dipole resonant experiments in the perturbative limit. Orientational correlation functions are calculated within the model of orientational diffusion for all third-order tensor components relevant to isotropic media. General expressions for polarization geometries that are selective to particular components of the signal, i.e., magic angles, are derived for collinear and crossed-beam excitation geometries. It is shown that although limited selectivity exists for Raman spectroscopies, no combination of polarizations will give complete selectivity to the isotropic, anisotropic, or nonresonant contributions to the Raman polarizability tenser. For resonant spectroscopies, the four-time correlation function that describes the orientational polarization decay can be written as the product of three two-time correlation functions. While magic angles for orientational relaxation will exist for experiments that probe population dynamics, such as pump-probe and transient grating spectroscopies, orientational relaxation cannot be removed from coherence experiments such as the photon echo.

abstract = {The simulation of diffusional association (SDA) Brownian dynamics software package has been widely used in the study of biomacromolecular association. Initially developed to calculate bimolecular protein–protein association rate constants, it has since been extended to study electron transfer rates, to predict the structures of biomacromolecular complexes, to investigate the adsorption of proteins to inorganic surfaces, and to simulate the dynamics of large systems containing many biomacromolecular solutes, allowing the study of concentration-dependent effects. These extensions have led to a number of divergent versions of the software. In this article, we report the development of the latest version of the software (SDA 7). This release was developed to consolidate the existing codes into a single framework, while improving the parallelization of the code to better exploit modern multicore shared memory computer architectures. It is built using a modular object-oriented programming scheme, to allow for easy maintenance and extension of the software, and includes new features, such as adding flexible solute representations. We discuss a number of application examples, which describe some of the methods available in the release, and provide benchmarking data to demonstrate the parallel performance.},

abstract = {We describe different Bayesian ensemble refinement methods, examine their interrelation, and discuss their practical application. With ensemble refinement, the properties of dynamic and partially disordered (bio)molecular structures can be characterized by integrating a wide range of experimental data, including measurements of ensemble-averaged observables. We start from a Bayesian formulation in which the posterior is a functional that ranks different configuration space distributions. By maximizing this posterior, we derive an optimal Bayesian ensemble distribution. For discrete configurations, this optimal distribution is identical to that obtained by the maximum entropy "ensemble refinement of SAXS" (EROS) formulation. Bayesian replica ensemble refinement enhances the sampling of relevant configurations by imposing restraints on averages of observables in coupled replica molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the strength of the restraint should scale linearly with the number of replicas to ensure convergence to the optimal Bayesian result in the limit of infinitely many replicas. In the "Bayesian inference of ensembles" (BioEn) method, we combine the replica and EROS approaches to accelerate the convergence. An adaptive algorithm can be used to sample directly from the optimal ensemble, without replicas. We discuss the incorporation of single-molecule measurements and dynamic observables such as relaxation parameters. The theoretical analysis of different Bayesian ensemble refinement approaches provides a basis for practical applications and a starting point for further investigations.},

abstract = {The solution structure of the DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 has been studied in an aqueous liquid crystalline medium containing 5{\%} w/v bicelles. These phospholipid particles impose a small degree of orientation on the DNA duplex molecules with respect to the magnetic field and permit the measurement of dipolar interactions. Experiments were carried out on several samples with different isotopic labeling patterns, including two complementary samples, in which half of the nucleotides were uniformly enriched with 13C and deuterated at the H2` `and H5` positions. From this, 198 13C1H and 10 15N1H one-bond dipolar coupling restraints were derived, in addition to 200 approximate 1H1H dipolar coupling and 162 structurally meaningful NOE restraints. Although loose empirical restraints for the phosphodiester backbone torsion angles were essential for obtaining structures that satisfy all experimental data, they do not contribute to the energetic penalty function of the final minimized structures. Except for additional regular WatsonCrick hydrogen bond restraints and standard van der Waals and electrostatic terms used in the molecular dynamics-based structure calculation, the structure is determined primarily by the dipolar couplings. The final structure is highly regular, without any significant bending or kinks, and with C2`-endo/C1`-exo sugar puckers corresponding to regular B-form DNA. Most local parameters, including sugar puckers, glycosyl torsion angles, and propeller twists, are also tightly determined by the NMR data. The precision of the determined structures is limited primarily by the uncertainty in the exact magnitude and rhombicity of the alignment tensor. This causes considerable spread in parameters such as the degree of base-pair opening and the width of the minor groove, which are relatively sensitive to the alignment tensor values used.},

abstract = {We investigated effects of hydrodynamic anisotropy on the kinetics of a diffusional encounter of a bacterial ribonuclease, barnase, and its natural inhibitor barstar, using the rigid-body Brownian dynamics technique. We performed atomistically detailed Brownian dynamics simulations of barnase and barstar under periodic boundary conditions, taking into account excluded volume and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the proteins. We studied their specific (i.e., orientationally restricted by their configuration in the X-ray complex) and nonspecific association, either taking into account hydrodynamic anisotropy of the proteins or treating them as hydrodynamically equivalent spheres. We found that even relatively small anisotropy of associating proteins may influence the rate of their encounter and this effect is quantitatively measurable in the simulations. The role of the anisotropic diffusion manifests itself only in case of specific encounters while the association toward nonspecific complexes is not influenced by anisotropic diffusion. Association rate constants obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations for the studied system are up to 20{\%} larger when hydrodynamic anisotropies of barnase and barstar are taken into account. Moreover, the dissociation from the specific complex is also accelerated in case of anisotropic diffusio},

abstract = {The k-d tree data structure is implemented in a Monte Carlo (MC) molecular simulation program to accelerate the range search for particles or interaction sites within the cutoff distance when Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions are computed. MC simulations are performed for different molecules in various ensembles to assess the efficiency enhancements due to the k-d tree data structure. It is found that the use of k-d trees accelerates significantly simulations for Lennard-Jones particles in the NVT and NVT-Gibbs ensembles and for n-butane and 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22-undecamethylpentacosane represented by the TraPPE-UA force field in the NpT ensemble. Simulations for TraPPE-UA ethanol in the NpT ensemble and for the rigid TIP4P water model in the Gibbs ensemble gain slightly in efficiency with the k-d tree, whereas simulations for TIP4P water in the NpT ensemble do not benefit from the use of the k-d tree. The speed-up can be attributed to the reduction in the number of distance calculations in the range search from scaling as O(N) to O(log{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}N). In addition, these tests suggest that the efficiency gain from the use of the k-d tree data structure depends on the flexibility of the molecular model (requiring configurational-bias MC moves to sample changes in conformation), on the ensemble (with open ensembles requiring special MC moves to aid particle transfers), and on the number of interaction sites per molecule (with compact multisite models not seeing an efficiency gain). Overall, the use of the k-d tree data structure can substantially enhance MC simulation efficiency for a variety of systems, and it will enable simulations for larger system sizes in the future.},

Molecular simulations that neglect hydrodynamic interactions are incapable of simultaneously reproducing the expected experi- mental translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of folded proteins, drastically underes- timating both when reasonable hydrodynamic radii are employed. In contrast, simulations that include hydrodynamic interactions produce diffusion coefficients that match very well with the expected experimental values for translation and rotation and also correctly capture the significant decrease in translational diffusion coefficient that accompanies protein unfolding. These effects are reflected in folding simulations of the same proteins: the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions accelerates folding by 2-3-fold with the rate enhancement for the association of secondary structure elements exhibiting a strong sensitivity on the sequence-distance between the associating elements.},

Protein-protein interactions also resulted in significant variations in reduced macromolecular diffusion under crowded conditions, while metabolites exhibited significant two-dimensional surface diffusion and altered protein-ligand binding that may reduce the effective concentration of metabolites and ligands in vivo. Metabolic enzymes showed weak non-specific association in cellular environments attributed to solvation and entropic effects.

abstract = {Spectroscopic studies have identified a number of proteins that appear to retain significant residual structure under even strongly denaturing conditions. Intrinsic viscosity, hydrodynamic radii, and small-angle x-ray scattering studies, in contrast, indicate that the dimensions of most chemically denatured proteins scale with polypeptide length by means of the power-law relationship expected for random-coil behavior. Here we further explore this discrepancy by expanding the length range of characterized denatured-state radii of gyration (R(G)) and by reexamining proteins that reportedly do not fit the expected dimensional scaling. We find that only 2 of 28 crosslink-free, prosthetic-group-free, chemically denatured polypeptides deviate significantly from a power-law relationship with polymer length. The R(G) of the remaining 26 polypeptides, which range from 16 to 549 residues, are well fitted (r(2) = 0.988) by a power-law relationship with a best-fit exponent, 0.598 +/- 0.028, coinciding closely with the 0.588 predicted for an excluded volume random coil. Therefore, it appears that the mean dimensions of the large majority of chemically denatured proteins are effectively indistinguishable from the mean dimensions of a random-coil ensemble.},

Folding trajectories, generated by using single-molecule force-clamp experiments by attaching semiflexible polymers to the ends of hairpins, have been used to infer their folding landscapes. Using simulations and theory, we study the effect of the dynamics of the attached handles on the handle-free RNA free-energy profile F(o)(eq)(z(m)), where z(m) is the molecular extension of the hairpin. Accurate measurements of F(o)(eq)(z(m)) requires stiff polymers with small L/l(p), where L is the contour length of the handle, and l(p) is the persistence length. Paradoxically, reliable estimates of the hopping rates can only be made by using flexible handles. Nevertheless, we show that the equilibrium free-energy profile F(o)(eq)(z(m)) at an external tension f(m), the force (f) at which the folded and unfolded states are equally populated, in conjunction with Kramers' theory, can provide accurate estimates of the force-dependent hopping rates in the absence of handles at arbitrary values of f. Our theoretical framework shows that z(m) is a good reaction coordinate for nucleic acid hairpins under tension.},

abstract = {Attractive inter-residue contact energies for proteins have been re-evaluated with the same assumptions and approximations used originally by us in 1985, but with a significantly larger set of protein crystal structures. An additional repulsive packing energy term, operative at higher densities to prevent overpacking, has also been estimated for all 20 amino acids as a function of the number of contacting residues, based on their observed distributions. The two terms of opposite sign are intended to be used together to provide an estimate of the overall energies of inter-residue interactions in simplified proteins without atomic details. To overcome the problem of how to utilize the many homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank, a new scheme has been devised to assign different weights to each protein, based on similarities among amino acid sequences. A total of 1168 protein structures containing 1661 subunit sequences are actually used here. After the sequence weights have been applied, these correspond to an effective number of residue-residue contacts of 113,914, or about six times more than were used in the old analysis. Remarkably, the new attractive contact energies are nearly identical to the old ones, except for those with Leu and the rarer amino acids Trp and Met. The largest change found for Leu is surprising. The estimates of hydrophobicity from the contact energies for non-polar side-chains agree well with the experimental values. In an application of these contact energies, the sequences of 88 structurally distinct proteins in the Protein Data Bank are threaded at all possible positions without gaps into 189 different folds of proteins whose sequences differ from each other by at least 35{\%} sequence identity. The native structures for 73 of 88 proteins, excluding 15 exceptional proteins such as membrane proteins, are all demonstrated to have the lowest alignment energies.},

Understanding how the high concentration of solutes affects the dynamic properties of biological macromolecules is fundamental for the comprehension of biological processes in living systems. In this paper, we describe the implementation of mean field models of translational and rotational hydrodynamic interactions into an atomically detailed many-protein brownian dynamics simulation method. Concentrated solutions (30-40{\%} volume fraction) of myoglobin, hemoglobin A, and sickle cell hemoglobin S were simulated, and static structure factors, oligomer formation, and translational and rotational self-diffusion coefficients were computed. Good agreement of computed properties with available experimental data was obtained. The results show the importance of both solvent mediated interactions and weak protein-protein interactions for accurately describing the dynamics and the association properties of concentrated protein solutions. Specifically, they show a qualitative difference in the translational and rotational dynamics of the systems studied. Although the translational diffusion coefficient is controlled by macromolecular shape and hydrodynamic interactions, the rotational diffusion coefficient is affected by macromolecular shape, direct intermolecular interactions, and both translational and rotational hydrodynamic interactions.},

abstract = {Unfolded states of proteins and native states of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) populate heterogeneous conformational ensembles in solution. The average sizes of these heterogeneous systems, quantified by the radius of gyration (RG ), can be measured by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Another parameter, the mean dye-to-dye distance (RE ) for proteins with fluorescently labeled termini, can be estimated using single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET). A number of studies have reported inconsistencies in inferences drawn from the two sets of measurements for the dimensions of unfolded proteins and IDPs in the absence of chemical denaturants. These differences are typically attributed to the influence of fluorescent labels used in smFRET and to the impact of high concentrations and averaging features of SAXS. By measuring the dimensions of a collection of labeled and unlabeled polypeptides using smFRET and SAXS, we directly assessed the contributions of dyes to the experimental values RG and RE For chemically denatured proteins we obtain mutual consistency in our inferences based on RG and RE , whereas for IDPs under native conditions, we find substantial deviations. Using computations, we show that discrepant inferences are neither due to methodological shortcomings of specific measurements nor due to artifacts of dyes. Instead, our analysis suggests that chemical heterogeneity in heteropolymeric systems leads to a decoupling between RE and RG that is amplified in the absence of denaturants. Therefore, joint assessments of RG and RE combined with measurements of polymer shapes should provide a consistent and complete picture of the underlying ensembles.},

The ellipsoid is subject to small random changes in orientation in which the rotation probabilities about its three major axes are different. This anisotropic motion yields five nuclear correlation times; isotropic motion yields only one correlation time. The results are applicable provided that the static dipolar coupling is effectively averaged to small values by the rotational motion. For nonviscous liquids, T 1 = T 2. When the rotation probabilities about two axes are equal, the relaxation‐time expressions simplify a great deal, but they retain the essential relaxation features of anisotropic rotational motion; the number of nuclear correlation times is reduced to three; the relaxation times for rapid motion have been calculated as a function of the ratio of the two rotation probabilities for this case. The relaxation rates in ellipsoids of revolution obeying the Stokes approximation for motion in a continuous medium have been compared to those for spheres having the same volume. The rates for very nonspherical particles are large compared to those for the spheres. An example of internal motion of the internuclear vector within the ellipsoid is calculated.},

Rapid, electrostatically assisted association of proteins. Nat. Struct. Biol. 3:427- 431), implying that their association is electrostatically facilitated. We report Brownian dynamics simulations of the diffusional association of barnase and barstar to compute association rates and their dependence on ionic strength and protein mutation. Crucial to the ability to reproduce experimental rates is the definition of encounter complex formation at the endpoint of diffusional motion. Simple definitions, such as a required root mean square (RMS) distance to the fully bound position, fail to explain the large influence of some mutations on association rates. Good agreement with experiments could be obtained if satisfaction of two intermolecular residue contacts was required for encounter complex formation. In the encounter complexes, barstar tends to be shifted from its position in the bound complex toward the guanine-binding loop on barnase.},

abstract = {Topology has been shown to be an important determinant of many features of protein folding; however, the delineation of sequence effects on folding remains obscure. Furthermore, differentiation between the two influences proves difficult due to their intimate relationship. To investigate the effect of sequence in the absence of significant topological differences, we examined the folding mechanisms of segment B1 peptostreptococcal protein L and segment B1 of streptococcal protein G. These proteins share the same highly symmetrical topology. Despite this symmetry, neither protein folds through a symmetrical transition state. We analyzed the origins of this difference using theoretical models. We found that the strength of the interactions present in the N-terminal hairpin of protein L causes this hairpin to form ahead of the C-terminal hairpin. The difference in chain entropy associated with the formation of the hairpins of protein G proves sufficient to beget initiation of folding at the shorter C-terminal hairpin. Our findings suggest that the mechanism of folding may be understood by examination of the free energy associated with the formation of partially folded microstates.},

The SNARE complex applies attractive forces to overcome the long-range repulsion between the vesicle and membrane. To understand how the balance between the attractive and repulsive forces defines the equilibrium docked state we have developed a model that combines the mechanics of vesicle/membrane deformation with an apparently new coarse-grained model of the SNARE complex. The coarse-grained model of the SNARE complex is calibrated by comparison with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations as well as by force measurements in laser tweezer experiments. The model for vesicle/membrane interactions includes the forces produced by membrane deformation and hydration or electrostatic repulsion. Combining these two parts, the coarse-grained model of the SNARE complex with membrane mechanics, we study how the equilibrium docked state varies with the number of SNARE complexes. We find that a single SNARE complex is able to bring a typical synaptic vesicle to within a distance of ∼3 nm from the membrane. Further addition of SNARE complexes shortens this distance, but an overdocked state of {\textgreater}4-6 SNAREs actually increases the equilibrium distance.},

abstract = {We develop coarse-grained models and effective energy functions for simulating thermodynamic and structural properties of multiprotein complexes with relatively low binding affinity (Kd {\textgreater} 1 $\mu$M) and apply them to binding of Vps27 to membrane-tethered ubiquitin. Folded protein domains are represented as rigid bodies. The interactions between the domains are treated at the residue level with amino-acid-dependent pair potentials and Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel-type electrostatic interactions. Flexible linker peptides connecting rigid protein domains are represented as amino acid beads on a polymer with appropriate stretching, bending, and torsion-angle potentials. In simulations of membrane-attached protein complexes, interactions between amino acids and the membrane are described by residue-dependent short-range potentials and long-range electrostatics. We parameterize the energy functions by fitting the osmotic second virial coefficient of lysozyme and the binding affinity of the ubiquitin-CUE complex. For validation, extensive replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations are performed of various protein complexes. Binding affinities for these complexes are in good agreement with the experimental data. The simulated structures are clustered on the basis of distance matrices between two proteins and ranked according to cluster population. In ∼ 70{\%} of the complexes, the distance root-mean-square is less than 5 {\AA} from the experimental structures. In ∼ 90{\%} of the complexes, the binding interfaces on both proteins are predicted correctly, and in all other cases at least one interface is correct. Transient and nonspecifically bound structures are also observed. With the validated model, we simulate the interaction between the Vps27 multiprotein complex and a membrane-tethered ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is found to bind preferentially to the two UIM domains of Vps27, but transient interactions between ubiquitin and the VHS and FYVE domains are observed as well. These specific and nonspecific interactions are found to be positively cooperative, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the overall binding affinity beyond the ∼ 300 $\mu$M of the specific domains. We also find that the interactions between ubiquitin and Vps27 are highly dynamic, with conformational rearrangements enabling binding of Vps27 to diverse targets as part of the multivesicular-body protein-sorting pathway.},

A model system for studying this issue is myoglobin, a simple haem protein. Myoglobin has been studied extensively by spectroscopy, crystallography, computation and theory. It serves as an aid to oxygen diffusion but also binds carbon monoxide, a byproduct of endogenous haem catabolism.

abstract = {The extremely powerful technique of molecular dynamics simulation involves solving the classical many-body problem in contexts relevant to the study of matter at the atomistic level. Since there is no alternative approach capable of handling this broad range of problems at the required level of detail, molecular dynamics meth- ods have proved themselves indispensable in both pure and applied research. This book is a blend of tutorial and recipe collection, providing both an introduction to the subject for beginners and a reference manual for more experienced practition- ers. It is organized as a series of case studies that take the reader through each of the steps from formulating the problem, developing the necessary software, and then using the programs to make actual measurements. This second edition has been extensively revised and enlarged. It contains a sub- stantial amount of new material and the software used in the case studies has been completely rewritten.},

abstract = {Chemical denaturants are the most commonly used agents for unfolding proteins and are thought to act by better solvating the unfolded state. Improved solvation is expected to lead to an expansion of unfolded chains with increasing denaturant concentration, providing a sensitive probe of the denaturant action. However, experiments have so far yielded qualitatively different results concerning the effects of chemical denaturation. Studies using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and other methods found an increase in radius of gyration with denaturant concentration, but most small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies found no change. This discrepancy therefore challenges our understanding of denaturation mechanism and more generally the accuracy of these experiments as applied to unfolded or disordered proteins. Here, we use all-atom molecular simulations to investigate the effect of urea and guanidinium chloride on the structure of the intrinsically disordered protein ACTR, which can be studied by experiment over a wide range of denaturant concentration. Using unbiased molecular simulations with a carefully calibrated denaturant model, we find that the protein chain indeed swells with increasing denaturant concentration. This is due to the favorable association of urea or guanidinium chloride with the backbone of all residues and with the side-chains of almost all residues, with denaturant−water transfer free energies inferred from this association in reasonable accord with experimental estimates. Interactions of the denaturants with the backbone are dominated by hydrogen bonding, while interactions with side- chains include other contributions. By computing FRET efficiencies and SAXS intensities at each denaturant concentration, we show that the simulation trajectories are in accord with both experiments on this protein, demonstrating that there is no fundamental inconsistency between the two types of experiment. Agreement with experiment also supports the picture of chemical denaturation described in our simulations, driven by weak association of denaturant with the protein. Our simulations support some assumptions needed for each experiment to accurately reflect changes in protein size, namely, that the commonly used FRET chromophores do not qualitatively alter the results and that possible effects such as preferential solvent partitioning into the interior of the chain do not interfere with the determination of radius of gyration from the SAXS experiments.},

abstract = {A new Lagrangian formulation is introduced. It can be used to make molecular dynamics (MD) calculations on systems under the most general, externally applied, conditions of stress. In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that the anticonvulsant effects of low-frequency stimulation (LFS) can be affected by activation of adenosine receptors. In the present study, the effect of LFS at different frequencies on kindling rate and adenosine receptors gene expression was investigated. METHODS: Animals were kindled by perforant path stimulation in a rapid kindling manner. LFS (0.5, 1, and 5 Hz) was applied after termination of each kindling stimulation. Seizure severity was measured according to behavioral and electrophysiologic parameters. At the end of the experiments, adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor gene expression were measured. RESULTS: The inhibitory effect of LFS on kindling acquisition was observed at all frequencies. In addition, the inhibitory action of LFS on enhancement of field excitatory postsynaptic potential slope and population spike amplitude during kindling acquisition was not affected by the LFS frequency. However, the effects of LFS on paired-pulse recordings were greater at frequency of 5 Hz. Application of LFS during kindling acquisition also prevented the kindling induced decrease in the A(1) receptor gene expression and attenuated the level of A(2A) receptor gene expression in the dentate gyrus. These effects were also greater at the frequency of 5 Hz. DISCUSSION: According to these data, it may be suggested that the antiepileptogenic effects of LFS, developed through inhibition of synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus, is mediated somehow through preventing the decrease of A(1) receptor and through attenuating the A(2A) receptor gene expression. These effects might be dependent on the frequency of LFS.},

abstract = {We derive simple analytical expressions for the error and computational efficiency of replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations (and by analogy replica exchange Monte Carlo simulations). The theory applies to the important case of systems whose dynamics at long times is dominated by the slow interconversion between two metastable states. As a specific example, we consider the folding and unfolding of a protein. The efficiency is defined as the rate with which the error in an estimated equilibrium property, as measured by the variance of the estimator over repeated simulations, decreases with simulation time. For two-state systems, this rate is in general independent of the particular property. Our main result is that, with comparable computational resources used, the relative efficiency of REMD and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is given by the ratio of the number of transitions between the two states averaged over all replicas at the different temperatures, and the number of transitions at the single temperature of the MD run. This formula applies if replica exchange is frequent, as compared to the transition times. High efficiency of REMD is thus achieved by including replica temperatures in which the frequency of transitions is higher than that at the temperature of interest. In tests of the expressions for the error in the estimator, computational efficiency, and the rate of equilibration we find quantitative agreement with the results both from kinetic models of REMD and from actual all-atom simulations of the folding of a peptide in water.},

@article{Vega2011,
abstract = {Over the last forty years many computer simulations of water have been performed using rigid non-polarizable models. Since these models describe water interactions in an approximate way it is evident that they cannot reproduce all of the properties of water. By now many properties for these kinds of models have been determined and it seems useful to compile some of these results and provide a critical view of the successes and failures. In this paper a test is proposed in which 17 properties of water, from the vapour and liquid to the solid phases, are taken into account to evaluate the performance of a water model. A certain number of points between zero (bad agreement) and ten (good agreement) are given for the predictions of each model and property. We applied the test to five rigid non-polarizable models, TIP3P, TIP5P, TIP4P, SPC/E and TIP4P/2005, obtaining an average score of 2.7, 3.7, 4.7, 5.1, and 7.2 respectively. Thus although no model reproduces all properties, some models perform better than others. It is clear that there are limitations for rigid non-polarizable models. Neglecting polarizability prevents an accurate description of virial coefficients, vapour pressures, critical pressure and dielectric constant. Neglecting nuclear quantum effects prevents an accurate description of the structure, the properties of water below 120 K and the heat capacity. It is likely that for rigid non-polarizable models it may not be possible to increase the score in the test proposed here beyond 7.6. To get closer to experiment, incorporating polarization and nuclear quantum effects is absolutely required even though a substantial increase in computer time should be expected. The test proposed here, being quantitative and selecting properties from all phases of water can be useful in the future to identify progress in the modelling of water.},

The properties are described in a very compact form with the aid of explicit expressions for programing on a computer and for inclusion in data banks. The paper includes a fundamental equation in the form of the Helmholtz free energy expressed as an analytic function of temperature and density. This fundamental equation is a dimensionless version of the Provisional IAPS Formulation 1982 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for Scientific and General Use, which enables one to calculate all equilibrium thermodynamic properties in a wide range of states, but with the exclusion of a small region near the critical point. In the latter region, the equilibrium properties are described by a scaled fundamental equation in the form of the pressure as a function of chemical potential and temperature. In addition, the paper gives equations for the viscosity,thermal conductivity, and surface tension. All equations in the paper are mutually thermodynamically consistent. The set of equations and their constants listed here represents the most reliable information according to the judgment of the authors.},

Good agreement between theory and simulation is obtained at the higher density. At the lower density, the agreement becomes poorer, but it is improved by taking into account the diffusion effect of the tagged particle. The equation gives the same diffusion coefficient for the infinite system as that obtained by taking into account the long-time tail contribution of the velocity autocorrelation function [B. J. Alder, D. M. Gass, and T. E. Wainwright, J. Chem. Phys. 53, 3813 (1970)]. When the tagged particle has a larger mass than the fluid particles, the equation presented here gives the better estimates.

abstract = {We performed molecular dynamics simulations of ubiquitin with the distinct water models, TTP3P, SPC, SPC/E, and SPC/Fw, in different system sizes with different box shapes. The translational diffusion constants of pure water linearly depend on the effective box length, which is known as finite size effect, whereas the first and second rotational times of pure water are nearly constant. We then observed that both the overall translation and rotational motions of the protein are linearly correlated to the viscosity of pure water. As expected from the finite size effect in pure water, the translational diffusion of the protein is significantly affected by the system size, and rotational diffusion is nearly size-independent. After correction for the finite size effect, the SPC/E and SPC/Fw models reproduce both the translational and rotational motion of the protein relatively well. Thus, water models that reproduce the experimentally derived diffusional properties of pure water accurately are expected to also be suitable for simulating protein diffusion quantitatively. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

We found that the C-H vectors in all cytosine ribose moieties within the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer (5'-CGCGAATTCGCG-3') are subject to high amplitude motions, while the other nucleotides are essentially rigid. MD simulations showed that repuckering is a likely motional model for the cytosine ribose moiety. Repuckering occurs with a time constant of around 100 ps. Knowledge of DNA dynamics will contribute to our understanding of the recognition specificity of DNA-binding proteins such as cytosine methyltransferase.},

abstract = {We investigate the dependence of single-particle diffusion coefficients on the size and shape of the simulation box in molecular dynamics simulations of fluids and lipid membranes. We find that the diffusion coefficients of lipids and a carbon nanotube embedded in a lipid membrane diverge with the logarithm of the box width. For a neat Lennard-Jones fluid in flat rectangular boxes, diffusion becomes anisotropic, diverging logarithmically in all three directions with increasing box width. In elongated boxes, the diffusion coefficients normal to the long axis diverge linearly with the height-to-width ratio. For both lipid membranes and neat fluids, this behavior is predicted quantitatively by hydrodynamic theory. Mean-square displacements in the neat fluid exhibit intermediate regimes of anomalous diffusion, with t ln t and t3/2 components in flat and elongated boxes, respectively. For membranes, the large finite-size effects, and the apparent inability to determine a well-defined lipid diffusion coefficien...},

abstract = {Protein-protein bond formations, such as antibody-antigen complexation or aggregation of protein monomers into dimers and larger aggregates, occur with bimolecular rate constants on the order of 10(6) M-1.s-1, which is only 3 orders of magnitude slower than the diffusion-limited Smoluchowski rate. However, since the protein-protein bond requires rotational alignment to within a few angstroms of tolerance, purely geometric estimates would suggest that the observed rates might be 6 orders of magnitude below the Smoluchowski rate. Previous theoretical treatments have not been solved for the highly specific docking criteria of protein-protein association--the entire subunit interface must be aligned within 2 A of the correct position. Several studies have suggested that diffusion alone could not produce the rapid association kinetics and have postulated "lengthy collisions" and/or the operation of electrostatic or hydrophobic steering forces to accelerate the association. In the present study, the Brownian dynamics simulation method is used to compute the rate of association of neutral spherical model proteins with the stated docking criteria. The Brownian simulation predicts a rate of 2 x 10(6) M-1.s-1 for this generic protein-protein association, a rate that is 2000 times faster than that predicted by the simplest geometric calculation and is essentially equal to the rates observed for protein-protein association in aqueous solution. This high rate is obtained by simple diffusive processes and does not require any attractive or steering forces beyond those achieved for a partially formed bond. The rate enhancement is attributed to a diffusive entrapment effect, in which a protein pair surrounded and trapped by water undergoes multiple collisions with rotational reorientation during each encounter.},

abstract = {A longstanding question in molecular biology is the extent to which the behavior of macromolecules observed in vitro accurately reflects their behavior in vivo. A number of sophisticated experimental techniques now allow the behavior of individual types of macromolecule to be studied directly in vivo; none, however, allow a wide range of molecule types to be observed simultaneously. In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and "snapshots" of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited "crowding" effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.},

While ab initio Drot prediction can be achieved by explicit all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, this is hindered by both computational expense and limitations in water models. We propose coarse-grained force fields as a complementary solution, and show that the MARTINI force field with elastic networks is sufficient to compute Drot in {\textgreater}10 proteins spanning 5–157 kDa. We also adopt a quaternion-based approach that computes Drot orientation directly from autocorrelations of best-fit rotations as used in, e.g., RMSD algorithms. Over 2 $\mu$s trajectories, isotropic MARTINI+EN tumbling replicates experimental values to within 10–20{\%}, with convergence analyses suggesting a minimum sampling of {\textgreater}50 × $\tau$theor to achieve sufficient precision.

@article{Dunweg1993,
abstract = {Results of a molecular dynamics simulation of a single polymer chain in a good solvent are presented. The latter is modeled explicitly as a bath of particles. This system provides a first‐principles microscopic test of the hydrodynamic Kirkwood–Zimm theory of the chain's Brownian motion. A 30 monomer chain is studied in 4066 solvent particles as well as 40/4056 and 60/7940 systems. The density was chosen rather high, in order to come close to the ideal situation of incompressible flow, and to ensure that diffusive momentum transport is much faster than particle motions. In order to cope with the numerical instability of microcanonical algorithms, we generate starting states by a Langevin simulation that includes a coupling to a heat bath, which is switched off for the analysis of the dynamics. The long range of the hydrodynamic interaction induces a large effect of finite box size on the diffusive properties, which is observable for the diffusion constants of both the chain and the solvent particles. The Kirkwood theory of the diffusion constant, as well as the Akcasu et al. theory of the initial decay rate in dynamic light scattering are generalized for the finite box case, replacing the Oseen tensor by the corresponding Ewald sum. In leading order, the finite‐size corrections are inversely proportional to the linear box dimensions. With this modification of the theory taken into account, the Kirkwood formula for the diffusion constant is verified. Moreover, the monomer motions exhibit a scaling that is much closer to Zimm than to Rouse exponents (t 2/3 law in the mean square displacement; decay rate of the dynamic structure factor ∝k 3). However, the prefactors are not consistent with the theory, indicating that (on the involved short length scales) the dynamics is more complex than the simple hydrodynamic description suggests.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. Capsid protein (CA) is the building block of virus coats. To help understand how the HIV CA proteins self-organize into large assemblies of various shapes, we aim to computationally evaluate the binding affinity and interfaces in a CA homodimer. We model the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of the CA as rigid bodies and treat the five-residue loop between the two domains as a flexible linker. We adopt a transferrable residue-level coarse-grained energy function to describe the interactions between the protein domains. In seven extensive Monte Carlo simulations with different volumes, a large number of binding/unbinding transitions between the two CA proteins are observed, thus allowing a reliable estimation of the equilibrium probabilities for the dimeric vs monomeric forms. The obtained dissociation constant for the CA homodimer from our simulations, 20-25 $\mu$M, is in reasonable agreement with experimental measurement. A wide range of binding interfaces, primarily between the NTDs, are identified in the simulations. Although some observed bound structures here closely resemble the major binding interfaces in the capsid assembly, they are statistically insignificant in our simulation trajectories. Our results suggest that although the general purpose energy functions adopted here could reasonably reproduce the overall binding affinity for the CA homodimer, further adjustment would be needed to accurately represent the relative strength of individual binding interfaces.
