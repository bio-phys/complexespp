The complexes model is a hierarchical \gls{cg} protein model that has been
implemented with a Monte-Carlo engine to generate structures of protein
complexes \cite{Kim2008}. The model is commonly refereed to as the \gls{KH}
model in the literature. Since the original publication, the forcefield has been
used in a large variety of applications. Those include the study the binding
kinetics of the HIV-1 capsid proteins \cite{Zhu2015, Sha2017}, the kinetic
behavior of proteins in crowded environments \cite{Kim2013, Kim2010a, Rosen2011,
  Dignon2018a}, folding of knotted protein \cite{Skrbic2012, ABeccara2013,
  Sirur2013, Covino2014a, Sirur2016, Covino2013}, enhancing the structural
resolution of experiments \cite{Rozycki2011, Kofinger2015, Baumlova2014,
  Rozycki2015, Chalupska2017}, protein-protein interactions \cite{Okazaki2012,
  Malinverni2017, Ravikumar2012}, protein design \cite{Yadahalli2014}, docking
\cite{Fortoul2015}, multi-enzyme complexes \cite{Rozycki2017, N2018, Horan2018,
  Rozycki2016}. The model has also been extended to simulate intrinsically
disordered proteins and protein phase separation \cite{Dignon2018a}.

The complexes model is implemented in a \mbox{C++14} program \complexes and a
\mbox{Python} tool \pycomplexes. \complexes implements the Monte-Carlo engine
and \pycomplexes is a helper library and \gls{CLI} tool to setup simulations and
visualize them, see \cref{fig:toc}. The Monte-Carlo integrator accepts input
files in the \cplx format and configuration files for simulations. The split
enforces that a well defined file format exists that uniquely defines a
simulation. We have decided to use the YAML standard \cite{YAML} for the \cplx
files. A library to write YAML files exists for many programming languages
allowing easier integration into existing workflow without forcing a specific
programming language.

\end{figure}

The complexes model describes proteins and large macromolecular structures at
three levels of coarse-graining. The first level is a bead. Beads are
interaction sites that are used to evaluate potentials and represent a single
amino acid, centered on the \calpha atoms. The second level is a domain. Domains
are collections of beads that define how the bead positions are propagated in a
simulation. The complexes model has rigid and flexible domains. The last level
is called a topology. It is a collection of connected domains. Topologies are
useful to develop efficient sampling algorithms for simulations with multiple
complexes. In this thesis, the general expression of the forcefield will be
referred to as the complexes model, when specific values for forcefield
parameters are given we refer to them as the \gls{KH} model. In the following,
the bead model and pair potential for different beads and different domains will
be explained.

\chapter{Beads}

\caption[Modified Lennard Jones potential used in \complexes.]{Modified Lennard

reduced units. The attractive branch \(\epsilon_{ij}<0\) is shown in blue, the
repulsive part \(\epsilon_{ij}>0\) is shown in orange and the branch for
\(\epsilon_{ij}=0\) in green. The gray dashed line shows the minima at
\(2^{1/6}\) of the attractive branch.}
\label{fig:lennard-jones}
\end{figure} Beads are the interaction sites at which the force field and
additional restraint potentials are evaluated. In the complexes model
\cite{Kim2008} amino acids are modeled as single beads centered on the \calpha
atoms. As energy function, a Lennard-Jones like potential is used for effective
interactions of native and non-native contacts and a Coulomb term with an
exponential screening term for the electrostatics. The potential energies are by
convention calculated in units of \(\kT\), with \(T=\SI{300}{K}\) as the
reference temperature.

The Lennard-Jones like potential \(U_{LJ}\), between beads \(i\) and \(j\),
consists of four different branches to model attractive and repulsive
interactions
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:complexesLJ}
  U_{LJ} (r, \sigma_{ij}, \epsilon_{ij}) = \begin{cases}
    4 \epsilon_{ij} \left[\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r}\right)^{6}\right] &\mbox{if } \epsilon_{ij} < 0 \\
    4 \epsilon_{ij} \left[\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r}\right)^{6}\right] + 2 \epsilon_{ij} &\mbox{if } \epsilon_{ij} > 0 \mbox{ and } r < 2^{1/6} \sigma_{ij} \\
    - 4 \epsilon_{ij} \left[\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r}\right)^{6}\right] &\mbox{if } \epsilon_{ij} > 0 \mbox{ and } r > 2^{1/6} \sigma_{ij} \\
    .01 \left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r}\right)^{12} &\mbox{if } \epsilon_{ij} = 0,
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
with $r$ the distance between the beads, the bead type pair parameters
\(\sigma_{ij}\) and \(\epsilon_{ij}\) for the contact distance and interaction
energy, respectively. For \(\epsilon_{ij} < 0\) this is the standard
Lennard-Jones potential, see \cref{fig:lennard-jones}. For \(\epsilon_{ij} > 0\)
this potential is purely repulsive, see \cref{fig:lennard-jones}. In case of
\(\epsilon_{ij}=0\) the potential is a hard wall slightly shorter than the
Lennard-Jones minimum of \(2^{1/6} \sigma_{ij}\) to avoid overlaps if additional
potentials are attractive and have singularities at \(r=0\), for example
electrostatic potentials. At contact \(r=\sigma_{ij}\) this potential gives
equal contributions from attractive and repulsive pairs with opposite sign. The
parameters \(\epsilon_{ij}\) are derived from the knowledge-based statistical
contact potentials \(e_{ij}\) by \gls{MJ} \cite{Miyazawa1996}. The \gls{MJ}
contact potentials have to be scaled to account for the added electrostatic
interactions and the preference of residue-residue to residue-solvent
interactions has to be balanced. In the complexes model this is done by scaling
with a parameter \(\lambda\) for the electrostatic interaction and shifting the
interaction with a parameter \(e_0\) for the residue-residue to residue-solvent
interactions with
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:complexesEpsilon} \epsilon_{ij} = \lambda (e_{ij} - e_0).
\end{align}
For the \gls{KH} model the values \(\lambda=0.159\) and \(e_0=\SI{-2.27}{\kT}\)
have been used, based on parametrizations to reproduce the experimental
determined second virial coefficient of hen egg lysozyme and the dissociation
constant \(K_d\) of the ubiquitin uim1 system \cite{Kim2008}. The contact
distances \(\sigma_{ij}\) are determined as weighted average \(\sigma_{ij} =
(\sigma_i + \sigma_j) / 2\) from the individual amino acids diameters,
\cref{tab:radii}. Note that in the original paper these values have been
incorrectly labeled as radii.

The electrostatic potential consists of Coulomb interactions with an
ionic-screening term
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:complexesDH}
  U_{el}(r) = \underbrace{\frac{q_i q_j e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 D_{el} r}}_{\text{coulomb}} \underbrace{\exp\left(\frac{-r}{\xi}\right)}_{\text{ionic-screening}} \underbrace{\frac{1}{\kT},}_{\text{scaling factor}}
\end{align}
with $e$ the elementary charge, $\epsilon_0$ the vacuum permittivity, $D_{el}$
the dielectric constant and \(\xi\) the Debye-length. The scaling factor of
\(1/\kT\) is used to convert the electrostatic energy into units of \(\kT\).
Bead charges are set according to amino acid type corresponding to a pH of 7.
Arginine and lysine are charged with $+e$, histidine with $+\frac{1}{2}e$, due
to its isoelectric point and aspartate and glutamine with $-e$. Charges for
other amino acids are set to 0. The ionic-screening term is used to set the salt
concentration of the environment with the Debye-length
\begin{align}
  \xi = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_r \epsilon_0 \kT}{e^2 N_A 2 I}},
\end{align}
where \(\epsilon_r\) the absolute permittivity, and \(I\) the ionic strength.
For a typical salt concentration of \SI{100}{mM} NaCl \(\xi \) is about
\SI{10}{\angstrom}.


\chapter{Domains}
Proteins and multiprotein complexes consist of multiple units that are connected
together. The domains are the second abstraction level of the complexes model
that connect beads. This abstraction is based on the assumption that a protein
complex consists of different proteins that behave as single units for a short
time span. There can be parts that are rigid during the lifespan of the protein
complex and short stretches of unstructured peptide chains that serve to tether
together as stiff parts. Domains are used to model this varied behavior. To
model the two different behaviors the complexes model has rigid and flexible
domains.

\section{Rigid Domain}
Rigid domains are the simplest form of a domain and the most versatile at the
same time. As the name suggests in a rigid domain the internal coordinates of
the beads in the domain do not change over time. Rigid domains are so versatile
because they can be used to model very different things. The obvious cases are
rigid protein parts like an $\alpha$-helix or a $\beta$-sheet. While not
described in the original complexes model it is possible to describe a rigid
domain at an even coarser level by grouping together amino acids. Using such a
\gls{cg} description requires finding new forcefield parameters for the
interactions but this versatility makes it possible to set up simulations that
incorporate experimental data with an appropriate detailed given experimental
uncertainties and prior knowledge.

\section{Flexible Domain}
\label{sec:flexible-domain} A compelling feature of the original complexes
implementation \cite{Kim2008} was its explicit treatment of flexible chains in
protein complexes. These chains served as an anchor to link rigid domains
together. In the original paper \cite{Kim2008} a peptide chain model using bond,
angle and dihedral potentials similar to \gls{MD} forcefields \cite{Hornak2006}
has been used. The advantage of such a model is that amino acids are modeled
explicitly and can interact with the rigid domains. A drawback of using this
model with a Monte-Carlo scheme is that only small movements of the whole chain
can be made to have small energy differences and therefore good acceptance
probabilities. As a side effect of this, the chain diffuses slowly through
configuration space and the overall diffusion of attached rigid domains is
limited by the linker instead of the translation and rotation step-size chosen
for the rigid domains. While such an explicit model can work for smaller
complexes \cite{Rozycki2011} it would make simulations of larger complexes
\cite{Kofinger2015} difficult.

A linker model that has a limited influence on the diffusion of the rigid
domains would be better suited to quickly sample configuration space. It has
been shown that for a linker only the length is important and not the exact
dynamics \cite{Rozycki2017}. We use this to make the assumption that the linker
only has to hold two rigid domains together and has no other functional purpose
and replace the explicit peptide chain with a \gls{PMF} that only depends on the
distance between the two rigid domains and the number of amino acids in the
linker. This \gls{PMF} potential acts as a restraint potential ensuring that the
distance between two rigid domains is physically correct. Because no explicit
beads are involved the diffusion of the rigid domains is only influenced by the
selected translation and rotation step-size. We can use a Gaussian chain polymer
model to calculate a suitable \gls{PMF}. Gaussian chains are suitable models
previously used to explain \gls{FRET} experiments \cite{OBrien2009}.

In the Gaussian chain model the beads are point particles connected by harmonic
springs. The average distance \(b\) between two beads determines the spring
constant. For a three dimensional chain the distances $R_{ij} = |\vec{r}_j -
\vec{r}_i|$ between beads \(i\) and \(j\), irrespective of the direction, is
distributed according to \cite{yamakawa1971modern}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ch5:gaussian} P(R_{ij}) = 4 \pi R_{ij}^2 \left(\frac{3}{2\pi \langle
R^2_{ij}\rangle}\right)^{3/2} \exp\left(-\frac{3R_{ij}^2}{2 \langle
R_{ij}^2\rangle}\right) , R_{ij} > 0,
\end{align} where \(\langle R^2_{ij}\rangle = b^2(j-i)\) is the mean squared
distances between beads \(i\) and \(j\). The factor \(4 \pi R_{ij}^2\) is the
volume element of a shell with width \(dR\) and radius \(R_{ij}\). The
end-to-end distance for a Gaussian chain with $N$ beads is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ch5:end2end} \sqrt{\langle R^2_{1N}\rangle} = \sqrt{N}b.
\end{align} To construct a \gls{PMF} for the Gaussian chain model we look at the
exponential term in \cref{eq:ch5:gaussian}. It is a similar expression as for
the Boltzmann distribution for a harmonic oscillator
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:harmonic-oscillator} V(\vec{r}_i, \vec{r}_j) =
\frac{3}{2b^2}\frac{1}{(j-i)}(\vec{r}_i - \vec{r}_j)^2,
\end{align} with spring constant $3/(b^2(j-i))$. From this the potential of mean
force between the ends of a Gaussian chain of length $N$ follows as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:PMF} PMF(\vec{r}_1, \vec{r}_N) = \frac{3}{2 b^2} \frac{1}{N-1}
(\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_N)^2.
\end{align} To compare the distribution of end-to-end distances obtained from
this \gls{PMF} we run a Monte-Carlo simulation using \cref{eq:ch5:PMF} for a
linker of length \(N=200\) and a bond length \(b=\SI{3.81}{\AA}\)
\cite{Best2005}, see \cref{fig:gauss-model}. The distribution of end-to-end
distances created using the PMF agrees well with the expected distribution of
the Gaussian polymer model. This \gls{PMF} has been previously used to model
proteins and \gls{RNA} \cite{Hyeon2008}.

  in orange. Results from an ensemble of 1 million distances obtained from a
  Monte-Carlo simulation using the PMF \cref{eq:ch5:PMF} are shown in blue. The
  value of the mean end-to-end distance, \cref{eq:ch5:end2end}, is marked in
  green.}
\label{fig:gauss-model}
\end{figure}

The final \gls{PMF} that we use will be between two beads of the two connected
rigid domains. These two beads have to be added to the length \(N\) of the
linker. Therefore the final \gls{PMF} for a linker of length \(N\) is
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:PMF-complexes} PMF(\vec{r}_0, \vec{r}_{N+1}) = \frac{3}{2 b^2}
\frac{1}{N+1} (\vec{r}_0 - \vec{r}_{N+1})^2,
\end{align} with \(\vec{r}_0\) and \(\vec{r}_{N+1}\) being the two beads of the
rigid domains that are connected by the linker.

\section{Generating Explicit Beads for Linker Model}

While the PMF, \cref{eq:ch5:PMF}, restraint potential, without explicit modeling
of the linker beads, is good for fast exploration of phase space some
applications, like the comparison of simulations to \gls{SAXS} measurements
\cite{Kofinger2015, Rozycki2011}, require to have explicit beads for the linker
domains. We now describe an iterative algorithm to generate positions for the
linker beads given fixed positions for the first and last bead of the linker.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/gaussian_chain_move}
\caption[Illustration of generating bead distances for a Gaussian polymer
model.]{Example of distances drawn for a new bead $N-1$ (green) between to fixed
  endpoints (orange) of a Gaussian linker of length $N$ in two dimensions. The
  red circle is the distance between the beads $N$ and $N - 1$. This distance is
  randomly chosen from \cref{eq:ch5:gaussian}. The bead $N-1$ can be placed
  anywhere on this circle. The distance between bead $1$ and $N-1$ now has to be
  chosen so that circle (blue) drawn around bead $1$ intersects with the first
  circle (red). In two dimensions this restricts the positions of the new bead
  to the two intersection points. In three dimensions it would be restricted to
  a sphere. }
\label{fig:algorithm}
\end{figure} Given the positions of bead $N$ and $1$ a single bead $N-1$ can be
generated with the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Randomly choose a distance \(d_{\mathrm{start}}\) between bead $N$ and
$N-1$ distributed according to \cref{eq:ch5:gaussian}. This distance defines a
sphere around bead N on which bead \(N-1\) will be placed. (
\cref{fig:algorithm}, red circle)
\item Choose a distance \(d_{\mathrm{end}}\) between bead $1$ and $N-1$ so that
the sphere around bead $1$ intersects with the sphere calculated in step 1.
(\cref{fig:algorithm}, blue cone)
\item Choose a random point on the intersection of the red and blue sphere to
place the bead \(N-1\) (\cref{fig:algorithm}, green bead). In three dimensions
the intersection is a circle so a random angle $\theta$ has to be drawn.
\end{enumerate} To grow the next bead, with index $N-2$, simply repeat the
algorithm with bead $N-1$ as new starting point to choose the random distance
\(R_{N-1,N-2}\). Repeat this algorithm until all beads are generated.
\begin{figure}[!ht] \centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/gaussian_chain_bead_construction.pdf}
\caption[Illustration of generating bead positions for a Gaussian polymer
model.]{Schematic for calculating for calculating the position of bead
$\vec{r}_{N-1}$ given the positions of $\vec{r}_N$, $\vec{r}_1$, the distances
$d$, $d_{\mathrm{start}}$, $d_{\mathrm{end}}$ and an angle $\phi$ (not shown).
The coordinate system $(\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z})$ is our reference coordinate
system. The coordinate system $(\vec{x'}, \vec{y'}, \vec{z'})$ is used to
calculate $\vec{r}_{N-1}$.}
\label{fig:bead-construction}
\end{figure} This algorithm gives the three distance between the beads and
orientation that uniquely determines where a new bead should be placed. To
calculate the actual coordinates in the coordinate system of the simulation we
are using the following algorithm.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine axis $\vec{z'}$ along the vector $\vec{r_N} - \vec{r_1}$.
  \item Determine perpendicular axes $\vec{x'}=\left(\frac{-z'_1-z'_2}{z'_0},1,
1\right)^T$ and normalize. Permutate in elements of $\vec{x'}$ if $z'_0=0$.
  \item Determine $\vec{y'} = \vec{x'} \times \vec{z'}$, with \(\times\) the
cross product.
  \item Determine angle \(\phi\) using the law of cosines
$\cos(\phi)=\frac{d_{\mathrm{start}}^2 + d^2 - d_{\mathrm{end}}^2}{ 2
d_{\mathrm{start}} d}$, with $d=|\vec{r_n} - \vec{r_1}|$ see
\cref{fig:bead-construction}.
  \item Calculate $\vec{r_{N-1}}$ in the coordinate system spanned by
$(\vec{x'}, \vec{y'}, \vec{z'})$ from the spherical coordinates given by
$(d_{\mathrm{start}}, \theta, \phi)$, see \cref{fig:bead-construction}.
  \item Convert $\vec{r_{N-1}}$ into reference coordinate system $(\vec{x},
\vec{y}, \vec{z})$.
\end{enumerate} Linker configurations generated using the above two algorithms
will include overlaps between neighboring beads, see \cref{fig:configuration}.
To avoid overlaps and generate more extended configurations it's sufficient to
add overlap checks in step 1 and 3 in the first algorithm algorithm, i.e. when
two beads are to close to each other.

\label{fig:configuration}
\end{figure}

\section{Relaxation of Gaussian Polymerchain} The structures produced by
the Gaussian chain growing algorithms are not very physical. The distances
between beads vary by a standard deviation of \SI{1}{\AA} with a mean of
\SI{5}{\AA} in a single chain when the chain is grown with overlap checks. The
fluctuation in typical protein structures is less than a hundredth of an
\SI{}{\angstrom} with a mean distance of \SI{3.81}{\AA} \cite{Best2005}. For the
generation of more physical bead coordinates, it is, therefore, necessary to
relax the structures generated by the previous algorithm. For the relaxation,
the force field developed by \citet{Kim2008} can be used.

The forcefield consists of bond potentials for pseudobonds for
\(C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\), angle potentials for pseudo angles
\(C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\) and torsion potentials for pseudo torsion
\(C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\). The bond potential is a
harmonic potential
\begin{align} U_{\mathrm{bond}} = \frac{1}{2} k (r-r_0)^2,
\end{align} with \(r\) the \(C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\) distance,
\(r_0=\SI{3.81}{\AA}\) the reference distance and \(k=\SI{378}{kcal ~ mol^{-1}
\AA^{-2}}\) the spring constant \cite{Karanicolas2002}. The pseudoangle
potentials is given a double well potential \cite{Best2005}
\begin{align} \exp[-\gamma U_{\mathrm{angle}}(\theta)] =
\exp[-\gamma(k_\alpha(\theta - \theta_\alpha)+\epsilon_\alpha)] + \exp[-\gamma
k_\beta(\theta - \theta_\beta)^2],
\end{align} where \(\theta\) is the angle between
\(C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\), the constants are
\(\gamma=\SI{0.1}{mol~kcal^{-1}}\), \(\epsilon_\alpha=\SI{4.3}{kcal ~
mol^{-1}}\), \(\theta_\alpha=\SI{1.6}{rad}\), \(\theta_\beta=\SI{2.27}{rad}\),
\(k_\alpha=\SI{106.4}{kcal ~ mol^{-1} rad^{-2}}\) and \(k_\beta=\SI{23.6}{kcal ~
mol^{-1} rad^{-2}}\). This potential accounts for the helical and extended
pseudoangles. The torsion potential is given by \cite{Karanicolas2002}
\begin{align} U_{\mathrm{torsion}}(\phi) = \sum_{n=1}^4 [1 + \cos(n\phi -
\delta_n)] V_n,
\end{align} where \(\phi\) is the torsion angle of the middle two beads in
\(C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\!-\!C_\alpha\). The constants \(V_n\) and
\(\delta_n\) are chosen for alanine as \(V_n=[0.936472, 2.307767, 0.131743
,0.613133]~\SI{}{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}\) and \(\delta_n=[287.354830,271.691192
,180.488748 ,108.041256]~\SI{}{rad}\) \cite{Karanicolas2002}.

The relaxation with the above described potential is done using a Monte-Carlo
algorithm. For trial moves the position of individual beads is changed. The
start and end bead are treated as fixed. For a linker of length \(N\) the
probability to pick a bead is uniform between all \(N-2\) beads that are allowed
to move. A sweep consists of \(N-2\) trial moves. Because the structure is only
supposed to be relaxed it isn't necessary to generate structures from an
equilibrium distribution and therefore detailed balance does not need to be
preserved. Here the move width is adjusted after each sweep to achieve a target
acceptance ratio of 30 \%. If after a sweep the acceptance ratio is larger than
30 \% the step-width is increased by 10 \% and decreased if the acceptance
ration is below 30 \%.

\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figures/linker-relaxation}
\caption[Monte-Carlo relaxation simulation of a Gaussian polymer
chain.]{Energies of a nonoverlapping Gaussian chain during relaxation. The chain
is 200 beads long and the initial structure was generated using the Gaussian
chain model with no overlaps. The acceptance rate during the Monte Carlo
simulation was set to target 30 \%. The bond energy is shown in blue, the angle
energy in orange, the torsion energy in green and the total energy in red.}
\label{fig:linker-relaxation}
\end{figure} Energy contributions for each potential from a relaxation run for a
chain of 200 beads is shown in \cref{fig:linker-relaxation}. In the beginning,
the energy is dominated by the bond potential, this is due to the fact that
average bond-length is larger than \SI{3.81}{\AA}. The bond lengths are fully
relaxed after around 200 sweeps. The angle potentials start to relax around
sweep 50 when the bond energy has already dropped by a factor of two. The angle
potential is fully relaxed after around 1000 sweeps. The last potential to relax
are the torsion angles. After about 500 sweeps the torsion angles start to see a
more pronounced decrease after 3000 sweeps when the other two potentials haven
been fully relaxed. The energy difference in the torsion potential from the
beginning of the simulation to the final structure is significantly less than
for the other two terms in the energy. The reason for this could be that the
starting structures generated by the Gaussian chain algorithm are particularly
ill chosen or that the simple spatial trial moves of the beads are not good for
relaxing this potential function.

the Gaussian chain algorithm can be seen in

been generated with the full potential, only the bond potential, and the bond
and angle potential. The structures have all been generated from the same
initial structure and relaxation runs where 1000 sweeps long. The bond potential
alone has the biggest visual influence on the structure by achieving a more
uniform bond distance. The addition of the angle potential also gives a visual
improvement. Differentiating the bond and angle potential structure from the
structure with the full potential is difficult as both are very similar.

\section{Comparison of Unfolded Proteins and Linker Model} To understand
how well the model describes unfolded protein regions I will compare the radius
of gyration $R_G$, as a measure of compactness, of our model with experimental
data. For unfolded proteins the $R_G$ has been determined experimentally in
dependence on the protein length with denaturants \cite{Kohn2004}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:plaxco} \langle R_G\rangle = R_0 N^{\nu},
\end{align} with \(R_0=1.927_{-0.238}^{+0.271}\)\SI{}{\AA} and \(\nu=0.598 \pm
0.028\). The radius of gyration of the Gaussian chain model is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ch5:rg} \langle R_G\rangle = \sqrt{\frac{1}{6} \frac{N (N+2)}{N+1}} b
\approx \sqrt{\frac{1}{6}} N^{1/2} b.
\end{align} This scaling behavior is slightly different with \(\nu=.5\) and
\(R_0=\SI{1.555}{\AA}\). Therefore it is unlikely that the Gaussian polymer
without overlap checks reproduces the $R_G$ values of a denatured protein for
any number of beads.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering \includegraphics{figures/plaxco}
  \caption[Radius of gyration of Gaussian polymer chain for different chain
  lengths.]{Radius of Gyration computed for a linker with of different number of
    amino acids. For each length 1000 structures have been generated with
    overlap check (orange), without (blue), and fill relaxation (green). Error
    bars donate the standard deviation. The experimental $R_G$ scaling law for
    denatured proteins \cite{Kohn2004} is shown as gray line.}
\label{fig:plaxco}
\end{figure} To compare the \(R_G\) scaling behavior of the linker growth
algorithm to the scaling of denatured proteins we generate 1000 different
structures for a linker of 25 to 200 beads length. To get the values of a truly
free chain for each simulation the linker was padded with 25 beads in the front
and end so that only the middle $N$ beads have been used to calculate the $R_G$.
The bond-length was set to \SI{3.81}{\AA} \cite{Best2005}. Start and end points
have been placed at the optimal end-to-end distance, \cref{eq:ch5:end2end}.
Results are shown in \cref{fig:plaxco}. As anticipated without an overlap check
the $R_G$ values are systematically different. But with overlap checks enabled
the Gaussian polymer is within one standard of the experimental values if
$N<50$.

It should be noted that for intrinsically disordered proteins it has been shown
that the \(R_G\) with denaturants is larger than of the protein observed in
natural conditions \cite{Fuertes2017, Song2017, Zheng2016, Borgia2016}.
Therefore our Gaussian polymer model is a good enough description for the
flexible domains. A similar model has been employed to study intrinsically
disordered proteins \cite{Dignon2018a}.

\chapter{Topologies}

Topologies are a collection of connected domains. They can be used to model
large protein complexes that consist of multiple domains. The connection is
typically modeled as a distance based potential between two beads of the
connected domains. The connection potential can be chosen according to the
Gaussian chain model \cref{eq:ch5:PMF} or as a normal harmonic spring.


\chapter{Pair Interactions Potentials}

In \complexes pair potentials are called pair kernels following a common
terminology used in computer science. The parameters of all available pair
kernels are given in the forcefield class. The parameters \(\sigma_{ij}\) and
\(\epsilon_{ij}\) are set according to bead type and shared between the
pair-kernels. During a simulation pair-kernels can be chosen for each individual
domain type pair present in the simulation, allowing to fine tune the
interactions. The Lennard-Jones like potential \cref{eq:ch5:complexesLJ} in
combination with the electrostatic potential \cref{eq:ch5:complexesDH}, and
several other potentials have been implemented. One additional potential is the
\gls{WCA} potential \cite{Weeks1971}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:wca}
  U_{\mathrm{WCA}} (r, \sigma_{ij}, \epsilon_{ij}) = \begin{cases} -\epsilon_{ij} &\mbox{if } r < 2^{1/6}\sigma_{ij} \\
    4\epsilon_{ij} \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r} \right)^{6}\right] &\mbox{if } \epsilon_{ij} > 0.
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
An alternative version of the Lennard-Jones like potential that smoothly decays
to zero is implemented with the following smoothing term
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:smooth} F_{\mathrm{smooth}}(r, a, b) =
  \begin{cases} 1 &\mbox{if } r/\sigma_{ij} < a \\ 0 &\mbox{if } r/\sigma_{ij} >
b \\ \frac{(b^2 - (r/\sigma_{ij})^2 )^2 (b^2 + 2 (r/\sigma_{ij})^2 - 3 a^2)}{ (b
- a)^3} &\mbox{ otherwise },
  \end{cases}
\end{align}
with \(a=\SI{1.4}{\AA}\) and \(b=\SI{1.8}{\AA}\) being the bound in which the
potential decays to 0. The value for \(a\) and \(b\) are hard coded. A purely
repulsive potential with
\begin{align}
  U_{\mathrm{repulsive}} = \left( \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r}\right)^{12}
\end{align}
is also implemented. Also implemented is a soft-core potential \cite{Antes2010a}
that allows to tune how soft the beads are and therefore they can potentially
overlap. The soft-core potential is a modification of the Lennard-Jones like
potential without the explicit repulsion branch,
\begin{align}
  U_{\mathrm{SC}}(r_{ij}) = 4\epsilon_{ij}\left[
\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}^6}{\alpha\sigma_{ij}^6 + (r_{ij}-s)^6}\right)^2 -
\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}^6}{\alpha\sigma_{ij}^6 + (r_{ij}-s)^6}\right)\right],
\end{align}
with \(\alpha\) the parameter to tune the softness of the beads, and
$s=\left(\sqrt[6]{2} - \sqrt[6]{2-\alpha}\right) \sigma_{ij}$ a shift parameter
to ensure that the minimum is always at \(\sqrt[6]{2}\) independent of
\(\alpha\). The other branches of the Lennard-Jones like potential can be
obtained by applying the same modifications. \(\alpha\) can be changed in the
range of zero to one, with \(\alpha=1\) allowing full overlap of the beads as
\(U_{\mathrm{SC}}(r=0)=0\) and \(\alpha=0\) recovering the Lennard-Jones like
potential \(U_{\mathrm{SC}}(r=0)=\infty\), \cref{eq:ch5:complexesLJ}. Because
this potential explicitly allows overlaps the electrostatics potential also has
to be changed to remove the divergence at \(r=0\). For this we use the potential
between two Gaussian charge distributions \cite{yarkony1995}
\begin{align}
  U_{\mathrm{el}}(r_{ij}) = \frac{q_i q_j}{4 \pi \epsilon_0
D}\frac{\mathrm{erf}\left(r_{ij}\sqrt{\lambda_{ij}}\right)}{r_{ij}}
\exp\left(-\frac{r_{ij}}{\zeta}\right) \frac{1}{\kT}
\end{align}
with \(\lambda_{ij}=\frac{\lambda_i \lambda_j}{\lambda_i + \lambda_j}\) and
\(\lambda_i\) the charge radius of bead \(i\). The charge radii are specified in
a forcefield for every bead type. In the standard \complexes forcefield all
radii are set to one.

\chapter{Replica Exchange Algorithms}

For enhanced sampling, \complexes implements replica exchange algorithms
\cite{Swendsen1986, Bennett1976, tuckerman2010statistical}. In replica exchange
simulations \(N\) independent copies of a simulation, which are further refereed
to as replicas, are run simultaneously and exchanged periodically. Implemented
are Temperature Replica Exchange \cite{Hansmann1997}, Hamiltonian replica
exchange \cite{Bussi2014} and pressure replica exchange \cite{Okabe2001}.

The implemented replica exchange algorithms differ by the acceptance function.
For temperature replica exchange the acceptance function for two configurations
\(i\) and \(j\) is \cite{Hansmann1997}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:REMC} W(i\rightarrow j) = \min(1, \exp\left( (\beta_j - \beta_i)
(U(x_j) - U(x_i)) \right)),
\end{align} with $U$ being the energy function, \(x_i\) the configuration of
replica \(i\) and \(\beta_i\) the temperature of replica \(i\). For Hamiltonian
replica exchange the acceptance function is \cite{Bussi2014}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:HREX} W(i\rightarrow j) = \min\left(1, \exp\left(
\frac{1}{\beta_i}(U_i(x_i) - U_i(x_j)) + \frac{1}{\beta_j}(U_j(x_j) - U_j(x_i))
\right)\right),
\end{align} with \(U_i\) the energy function of replica \(i\). For pressure
replica exchange the acceptance function is \cite{Okabe2001}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ch5:MPTMC} W(i\rightarrow j) = \min\left(1, \exp\left( (\beta_i -
\beta_j) (U(x_i) - U(x_j)) + (\beta_i P_i - \beta_j P_j) (V_i -
V_j)\right)\right),
\end{align} with \(P_i\) the pressure of replica \(i\) and \(V_i\) the volume of
replica \(i\).
